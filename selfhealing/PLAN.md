# BuildHub — Full Project Implementation Plan

> **Project:** BuildHub
> **Purpose:** Production-style developer collaboration platform and controlled test environment for the AI Self-Healing DevOps System.
> **Status:** Planning
> **Rule:** This file is the single source of truth for project progress.

# 0. Project Vision

BuildHub is a modern developer collaboration platform where users can:

* Create accounts
* Log in securely
* Manage profiles
* Create projects
* Create posts
* Comment on posts
* Like posts
* Manage projects and tasks
* Collaborate with other users

The application must behave like a realistic production web application.

BuildHub will later become the controlled environment for testing the AI Self-Healing DevOps System.

The self-healing system will eventually monitor BuildHub, intentionally inject failures, detect incidents, diagnose root causes, generate repairs, validate repairs, request human approval when required, safely apply changes, verify recovery, roll back failed repairs, and learn from successful repairs.

# 1. Project Goals

## Primary Goals

* [ ] Build a complete functional web application.
* [ ] Implement secure authentication.
* [ ] Implement user profiles.
* [ ] Implement social/community functionality (likes, comments).
* [ ] Implement project collaboration.
* [ ] Implement backend APIs.
* [ ] Implement persistent database storage.
* [ ] Implement comprehensive validation.
* [ ] Implement structured logging.
* [ ] Implement automated tests.
* [ ] Implement controlled fault injection.
* [ ] Make failures reproducible.
* [ ] Make application behavior observable.
* [ ] Prepare BuildHub for the AI self-healing system.

## Quality Goals

BuildHub must prioritize:

1. Correctness
2. Security
3. Maintainability
4. Testability
5. Observability
6. Recoverability
7. Clear architecture
8. Good user experience

---

# 2. Development Rules

All implementation must follow `AGENTS.md`.

Before implementing a task:

```text
AGENTS.md
    ↓
Relevant skills
    ↓
Relevant PLAN.md section
    ↓
Relevant source files
    ↓
Implementation
    ↓
Testing
    ↓
PLAN.md update
```

Do not:

* Implement tasks out of order without checking dependencies.
* Rebuild completed functionality.
* Add unnecessary dependencies.
* Modify unrelated features.
* Mark tasks complete without verification.
* Fake test results.
* Remove tests simply to make them pass.
* Introduce uncontrolled instability.

---

# 3. Project Phases

```text
Phase 0  → Foundation
Phase 1  → UI Foundation
Phase 2  → Authentication
Phase 3  → User Profiles
Phase 4  → Posts
Phase 5  → Projects
Phase 6  → Social Interactions
            └── Likes + Comments
Phase 7  → Testing + Observability
Phase 8  → Security + Attack Detection
Phase 9  → AI Self-Healing Engine
Phase 10 → Final Integration + Demo
```

Following, Notifications, Messaging, and Search are intentionally **out of roadmap scope**.

Do not begin a later phase until its required dependencies are complete.

# 9. Phase 5 — Projects

This is one of BuildHub's major features.

## 9.1 Create Project

Project fields (MVP):

```text
Name
Description
Owner
Status
Created date
Updated date
Slug (unique, derived from name)
```

Members are deferred to § 9.3.

Tasks:

* [x] Project database model (`Project` in Prisma: owner, name, unique slug, description, status enum).
* [x] Project creation API (`POST /api/projects`, name/description/status validation, slug generation with unique-suffix retry).
* [x] Project creation UI (create-project modal on `/projects`, Discover + My projects tabs, search + status filter).
* [x] Input validation (name 1–60, description ≤ 500, status in ACTIVE/COMPLETED/ARCHIVED).
* [x] Ownership rules (mutations require owner; 403 for non-owners).

---

## 9.2 Project Dashboard

Display (MVP):

```text
Project
├── Overview
├── Posts (linked updates)
└── Edit / Delete (owner)
```

Members, tasks, updates and discussions remain pending.

Tasks:

* [x] Project overview (header: name, status badge, owner, dates, post count; About description).
* [x] Project posts list (linked posts rendered as post cards).
* [ ] Member list.
* [ ] Task list.
* [ ] Project updates (currently represented by linked posts).
* [ ] Activity history.

---

## 9.3 Project Members

* [ ] Invite member.
* [ ] Remove member.
* [ ] View members.
* [ ] Permission handling.
* [ ] Ownership handling.

### Security Tests

* [x] Non-owner cannot perform owner-only action (server 403; UI hides owner menus).
* [ ] Removed member loses access.
* [ ] Unknown user cannot access private project.

---

## 9.4 Tasks

* [ ] Create task.
* [ ] Assign task.
* [ ] Change status.
* [ ] Edit task.
* [ ] Delete task.
* [ ] Filter tasks.

Task states:

```text
TODO
IN_PROGRESS
DONE
```

---


# 10. Phase 6 — Social Interactions

* [x] Update like count.
* [x] Prevent duplicate likes.

### Tests

* [x] Like.
* [x] Unlike.
* [x] Duplicate like.
* [x] Like nonexistent post.
* [x] Concurrent like behavior (API uses single upsert on `@@unique(userId, postId)`; idempotent under retry).

---

## 10.2 Comments

* [x] Create comment.
* [x] Display comments.
* [x] Edit own comment.
* [x] Delete own comment.
* [x] Validate comment content.

* [x] Edit comment.
* [x] Delete comment.
* [x] Unauthorized modification.

---

# 11. Phase 7 — Testing + Observability

Testing and observability provide the evidence base for the future self-healing engine.

## 11.1 API Standards

All APIs should have predictable:

```text
Success response
Validation error
Authentication error
Authorization error
Not found error
Server error
```

---

## 11.2 Validation

* [ ] Validate request bodies.
* [ ] Validate query parameters.
* [ ] Validate path parameters.
* [ ] Validate authentication.
* [ ] Validate authorization.
* [ ] Validate database constraints.

---

## 11.3 Error Handling

* [ ] Centralized error handling.
* [ ] Structured errors.
* [ ] Consistent HTTP status codes.
* [ ] Useful server logs.
* [ ] No leaked secrets.
* [ ] No stack traces in production responses.

---

## 11.4 Testing Infrastructure

Testing is a core part of BuildHub because the application will later be used to validate AI-generated repairs.

### 11.4.1 Unit Tests

* [ ] Authentication logic.
* [ ] Validation logic.
* [ ] Post logic.
* [ ] Like logic.
* [ ] Comment logic.
* [ ] Project logic.
* [ ] Task logic.

---

### 11.4.2 API Integration Tests

Test:

```text

Tasks
```

---

### 11.4.3 End-to-End Tests

Critical user flows:

### Flow A — Registration

```

---


This phase is essential for the future self-healing system.

## 11.5 Structured Logging

Implemented in `lib/server/logger.ts` + `lib/server/observability.ts`. Structured logs identify:

```text
Timestamp
Severity (INFO / WARN / ERROR / SECURITY)
Component (service)
Request / operation
Endpoint
Method
HTTP status
Error type (errorCode)
Error message
Request ID
```

- [x] Structured JSON-ish log rows persisted to the `LogEvent` table with `requestId` correlation.
- [x] Auth instrumentation: failed login logs `WARN errorCode=AUTH_FAILED`; successful login/registration logs `INFO`.
- [x] Observability operations (summary, incident list/detail, logs, report) log their own request for traceability.
- [x] Secrets/tokens/passwords are never logged.

---

## 11.6 Request Correlation

- [x] Generate request IDs (`x-request-id`, `crypto.randomUUID`) in `middleware`/`proxy.ts`.
- [x] Propagate IDs through backend operations via `resolveRequestId` + `logger`.
- [x] Include IDs in persisted log rows and incident `requestId` fields.
- [x] Related failures are traceable: finding request IDs surface in `securityEvents`, incident detail links its log events, `requestId` round-trips through incident creation.

---

## 11.7 Health Endpoints

Implemented at `GET /api/health` (public).

- [x] Application health (frontend + api + database + authentication + monitoring components).
- [x] Component health distinguishes `healthy` / `degraded` / `unavailable`.
- [x] Health reports are honest: with the seeded auth-failure burst, `authentication` is `degraded` and the endpoint reports overall `degraded` (never falsely healthy).
- [x] Includes `latencyMs`, `checkedAt`, and the aggregate `systemHealth` score.

---

## 11.8 Metrics

Exposed via `GET /api/observability/summary` (authenticated).

```text
Request activity     → recent log events + correlation IDs
Error count          → ERROR-level events in 24h window
Server error count   → status ≥ 500 in 24h window
Authentication failures → WARN + errorCode=AUTH_FAILED count
Not-found requests   → status 404 count
Per-route 4xx/5xx/frequency signals → security findings
Component health     → frontend / api / database / authentication / monitoring
Aggregate scores     → riskScore / cyberSafetyScore / systemHealth / activeIncidents
```

- [x] Request count signal (per-route frequency findings).
- [x] Error count + server errors.
- [x] Response latency (`latencyMs` on `/api/health`).
- [x] Database errors are observable (`server-error-spike` from 5xx events; DB-focused incidents carry `errorCode` like `DB_TIMEOUT`).
- [x] Authentication failures counted and surfaced.
- [x] Metric contract is fully deterministic (pure functions of DB state — see ADR-012).

---

## 11.9 Incidents + Log Persistence (Observability Domain)

- [x] Prisma models `Incident`, `IncidentEvent`, `AgentRun`, `Approval`, `LogEvent` (migration applied; existing migrations unchanged).
- [x] `GET /api/incidents` — authenticated, status/severity list filters (comma-separated), pagination.
- [x] `GET /api/incidents/[id]` — timeline events, related logs, agent runs, approvals, previous similar incidents (endpoint or title-keyword, capped at 5).
- [x] `GET /api/logs` — level/service/route/method/status/q/from/to filters + pagination.
- [x] Security findings are derived at read time (auth-failure burst HIGH, server-error spike HIGH, not-found burst MEDIUM, invalid-request MEDIUM, route-frequency LOW), excluding self-telemetry routes (`/api/observability/*`, `/api/health`).
- [x] `GET /api/observability/summary` combines scores, component health, findings, and recent logs.

---

## 11.10 AI Command Center UI (`/ai`)

- [x] Command shell route group `app/(command)` — server-layout auth gate (redirects to `/login`), sidebar (Overview, Incidents, Live Logs, AI Pipeline, History, Reports) + mobile drawer, always-dark mission-control theme.
- [x] Overview (auto-refresh 15s): Risk gauge + score tiles, component health, security observations, live ticker, active incidents, per-incident pipeline snapshot.
- [x] Incidents list (presets All/Active/Resolved/Rolled back, severity filter, pagination) and full detail page (meta, timeline, agent runs, approvals, related logs, previous similar, PDF download).
- [x] Live Logs viewer with filters; AI Pipeline page with Fixer → Critic → Judge flow cards; History view (reuses list with forced statuses); Reports page with one-click PDF downloads.
- [x] Command Center link surfaced in the app sidebar/mobile nav for authenticated users; guests see it nowhere.
- [x] Featured pipeline copy is explicitly a **simulation preview** — no external AI provider invoked, no automatic fixes, human approval always required.

---

## 11.11 PDF Incident Reports

- [x] `POST /api/incidents/[id]/report` → valid `application/pdf` (pdfkit), 2-page report per incident.
- [x] Report separates **OBSERVED FACTS** from **SIMULATED AI ANALYSIS** in its footer; never embeds credentials, session data, or secrets.
- [x] Section content mirrors the incident detail DTO (summary, scores, timeline, related logs, pipeline preview, approvals, previous incidents, advisory).

---

## 11.12 Deterministic Scoring Contract (ADR-012)

```
riskScore        = Σ active-incident risk weights + warning/error/finding penalties (capped)
cyberSafetyScore = 100 − Σ active-incident cyber impact
systemHealth     = weighted mean of component health (healthy 1 / degraded 0.9 / unavailable 0.2)
activeIncidents  = count of incidents with status in {DETECTED, INVESTIGATING, AWAITING_REVIEW}
```

Seeded demo baseline (verified by `scripts/verify-observability.mjs`, 45/45):
`riskScore 72 · cyberSafetyScore 94 · systemHealth 98 · activeIncidents 2`.

---

# 12. Phase 8 — Security + Attack Detection

Security validation and attack-detection readiness gate the application before it becomes a self-healing target.

Phase 8 adds a real, inspectable detection pipeline on top of the Phase 6/7 security baseline:

```text
BuildHub log_events
      ↓  (node scripts/dump-log-events.mjs → JSON)
Python security log analyzer (pure stdlib, real BuildHub logs only)
      ↓  (POST /api/security/findings, operator-authenticated)
SecurityFinding rows (fingerprint dedupe) → incidents + AgentRun mode="REAL"
      ↓
Deterministic risk engine (risk 0 / cyber 100 / health 100 / active 0 when clean)
      ↓
Real Groq Fixer → Critic → Judge (candidate text only, never auto-applied)
      ↓
Telegram alerting + live /ai Command Center (no fake data, no simulation labels)
```

## 12.1 Authentication

* [x] Password hashing (argon2, Phase 2, ADR-004).
* [x] Session/token security (opaque hashed sessions, Phase 2, ADR-004).
* [x] Logout behavior (Phase 2).
* [x] Session expiration (Phase 2, 7-day TTL + expiry checks).
* [x] Operator-scoped security endpoints: `/api/security/*` + `/api/telegram/test` require a session AND a username in `SECURITY_OPERATOR_USERNAMES` (default `arjun`) → 401 guest / 403 non-operator / 400 invalid payload.

## 12.2 Authorization

* [x] Resource ownership (Phase 4/5 posts + projects 403s).
* [x] Project permissions (Phase 5).
* [x] Admin permissions where applicable (none required — operator gate above covers Phase 8 surface).

## 12.3 Input Security

* [x] Request validation (zod everywhere, Phase 7 API standards).
* [x] Safe database queries (Prisma parameterized, Phase 7).
* [x] Output handling (DTO serializers, no secrets, Phase 7).
* [x] Protection against common injection classes (validated inputs; analyzer treats logs as untrusted data).

## 12.4 Secrets

* [x] No secrets in source code.
* [x] `.env` excluded from Git.
* [x] `.env.example` contains safe placeholders (extended with `GROQ_API_KEY`, `AI_PROVIDER`, `AI_MODEL`, `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`, `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID`, `COMMAND_CENTER_URL`, `SECURITY_OPERATOR_USERNAMES=arjun`).

## 12.5 Phase 8 Implementation Tasks

* [x] Step 1 — Baseline & schema: migration `20260829104339_phase8_security` adds `SecurityFinding` (fingerprint-unique, ruleId, severity, signal JSON, status DETECTED/PROCESSED/DISMISSED, hitCount, firstSeen/lastSeen), `TelegramNotification` (incidentId?, type INCIDENT/ESCALATION/TEST, deliveryStatus QUEUED/SENT/FAILED, telegramMessageId, error), `Incident.detectedBy`, `AgentRun.model` + `output JSON` + `error`. Seeded demo observability gated behind `SEED_OBSERVABILITY=1` (default off, no-fake-data). `reset-observability.mjs` is wipe-only. `verify-observability.mjs` asserts the clean baseline (risk 0 / cyber 100 / health 100 / active 0) — 28/28. ADR-013 supersedes the 72/94/98/2 seeded demo baseline (ADR-012).
* [x] Step 2 — `lib/server` modules: `risk.ts` (deterministic phase-8 risk/sub-scores, tier thresholds), `security.ts` (findings ingest/correlate/dedupe, incident promotion, `requireSecurityOperator()`, telegram tier uses global risk, fixerRootCause tracking), `ai.ts` (real Groq Fixer/Critic/Judge via `GROQ_API_KEY`, FAILED statuses + `AI ANALYSIS UNAVAILABLE`, never fake output), `telegram.ts` (threshold tiers, per-incident dedupe, never logs token), `routes-map.ts` (route-prefix → suspect-location hints). Provider locked to Groq (`qwen/qwen3.8-27b` validated live against the real agent JSON contract).
* [x] Step 3 — API routes: `POST /api/security/findings` (ingest + fingerprint dedupe), `POST /api/security/ingest` (findings → incidents/events + queued REAL AgentRuns), `POST /api/security/run` (Fixer → Critic → Judge + Telegram, mode="REAL"), `GET /api/security/status`, `POST /api/telegram/test` (message "BuildHub Telegram integration test"). All live-tested incl. 401 guest / 403 non-operator gates.
* [x] Step 4 — Analyzer: `frontend/scripts/security_log_analyzer.py` (pure stdlib; auth-failure-burst, repeated-401, repeated-403, not-found-burst, server-error-spike, invalid-request-burst, request-frequency-anomaly, endpoint-abuse-pattern, repeated-unauthorized-mutations) + `scripts/dump-log-events.mjs` + `scripts/test_security_log_analyzer.py` — 12/12 pass, contract version 2.
* [x] Step 5 — Command Center UI: removed all Simulation/SimLabel/fake-progress copy (now `LiveBadge` "Live · Real"), live pipeline with REAL modes + FAILED honesty states ("AI ANALYSIS UNAVAILABLE — <reason>" in pipeline/incident detail), Security view (`/ai/security`): real findings/incidents, operator actions (Run pipeline per incident, Test Telegram), live Groq model + Telegram connectivity panel, 3D `security-network` (client-only, WebGL-detected, reduced-motion/mobile CSS radar fallback), clean banner "ALL SYSTEMS SECURE", shell AI status shows "Groq Online/Unavailable". Verified: tsc clean, lint clean, build green, `/ai/{,security,pipeline}` 200 (session).
* [x] Step 6 — PDF reports: report.ts now labels runs REAL — Groq-backed, surfaces failed runs as "AI ANALYSIS UNAVAILABLE", and adds section 6.5 Alert Delivery (Telegram) with deliveryStatus/message id/error; filename `buildhub-incident-<ref>.pdf`. Verified live: POST returned 200 application/pdf with correct attachment name; pdftotext shows "6.5 Alert Delivery (Telegram) / SENT · INCIDENT · HIGH · message 122".
* [x] Step 7 — Verification tooling: `scripts/verify-security.mjs`, `scripts/e2e_phase8_full.py`, updated `scripts/e2e_phase7_full.py` (clean state), `PHASE8_SECURITY_COMMANDS.md`.
* [x] Step 8 — Full validation chain: lint → build → security API cohort → analyzer unit tests → live Groq + Telegram smoke → e2e phase 8 → phase 6/7 regression → wipe → clean `/ai` check → stop server → final report (AGENTS.md §54 format).

Architecture & direction locked (user-approved decision record — see ADR-013): transport is Node dump of real `log_events` → Python analyzer consuming JSON only → findings POSTed to Next.js (operator-authenticated) which owns incidents/AI/Telegram. No new secret for ingest; the future self-healing integration boundary is preserved (BuildHub exposes observability; it does not apply its own patches).

# 13. Phase 9 — AI Self-Healing Engine

This is the bridge between BuildHub and the AI Self-Healing System.

Fault injection must be:

* Controlled
* Reproducible
* Reversible
* Clearly identified
* Safe for development/demo environments

Never introduce uncontrolled random failures.

## 13.2 Fault Categories

### Easy

* [ ] Undefined variable.
* [ ] Typographical error.
* [ ] Wrong condition.
* [ ] Incorrect response field.
* [ ] Simple UI behavior failure.

### Medium

## 13.3 Failure Scenario Library

Every intentional failure must have a scenario definition.

Each scenario should document:

```text
Scenario ID
Name
Difficulty
Target component
Failure type
Expected symptom
Expected root cause
Expected validation
Recovery condition
Rollback condition
```

---

### Scenario E001 — Undefined Variable

```text
Difficulty: EASY
Target: Post creation
Failure: Runtime error
Expected: POST request fails
Expected root cause: Undefined variable
```

Validation:

```text
Create post → success
```

Status:

* [x] Implement
* [x] Reproduce
* [x] Validate
* [x] Document

> Implemented as **LOW-01** (POST /api/posts throws a TypeError when active). Reproduced via `scripts/verify-self-healing.mjs`; validated green.

---

### Scenario E002 — Field Typo

```text
Difficulty: EASY
Target: Post response
Failure: Incorrect object field
```

Validation:

```text
Post created
Post displayed correctly
```

Status:

* [x] Implement
* [x] Reproduce
* [x] Validate
* [x] Document

> Implemented as **LOW-02** (response field `post` renamed to `poost` when active). Reproduced + validated green.

---

### Scenario E003 — Incorrect Condition

```text
Difficulty: EASY
Target: Input validation
Failure: Invalid input accepted/rejected incorrectly
```

Status:

* [x] Implement
* [x] Reproduce
* [x] Validate
* [x] Document

> Implemented as **LOW-03** (server-side post validation min length flips to 1001 when active, rejecting valid posts). Reproduced + validated green.

---

### Scenario M001 — Broken Post API

```text
Difficulty: MEDIUM
Target: POST /api/posts
Failure: Server error
```

Expected investigation:

```text
Frontend
 ↓
API
 ↓
Business logic
 ↓
Database
```

Status:

* [x] Implement
* [x] Reproduce
* [x] Validate
* [x] Document

> Implemented as **MEDIUM-01** (POST /api/posts returns a 500 when active). Reproduced + validated green.

---

### Scenario M002 — Database Query Failure

```text
Difficulty: MEDIUM
Target: Feed
Failure: Database query exception
```

Expected:

```text
Feed request
 ↓
API failure
 ↓
Database error
```

Status:

* [x] Implement
* [x] Reproduce
* [x] Validate
* [x] Document

> Implemented as **MEDIUM-02** (GET /api/posts returns a 500 when active). Reproduced + validated green.

---

### Scenario M003 — Business Logic Error

```text
Difficulty: MEDIUM
Target: Project task
Failure: Incorrect status transition
```

The application remains operational but behaves incorrectly.

This scenario is important because not every production failure is an exception.

Status:

* [x] Implement
* [x] Reproduce
* [x] Validate
* [x] Document

> Implemented as **MEDIUM-03** (project PATCH ownership check inverted when active, allowing non-owners / denying owners). Reproduced + validated green.

---

### Scenario D001 — Authentication Failure

```text
Difficulty: DIFFICULT
Target: Authentication
Failure: Protected endpoint inaccessible
```

Expected root-cause investigation:

```text
Frontend
 ↓
Authentication API
 ↓
Authentication middleware
 ↓
Session/token
```

Status:

* [x] Implement
* [x] Reproduce
* [x] Validate
* [x] Document

> Implemented as **HIGH-01** (login password check removed when active — auth bypass). Reproduced + validated green.

---

### Scenario D002 — Authorization Failure

```text
Difficulty: DIFFICULT
Target: Project permissions
Failure: User incorrectly allowed/denied access
```

This scenario must be treated as high risk.

Status:

* [x] Implement
* [x] Reproduce
* [x] Validate
* [x] Document

> Implemented as **HIGH-02** (project DELETE ownership check removed when active — authorization bypass). Reproduced + validated green.

---

### Scenario D003 — Cascading Failure

Example:

```text
Database
 ↓
Project API
 ↓
Project page
 ↓
Comments
```

Expected behavior:

The system should identify the upstream root cause instead of treating every downstream error as an independent incident.

Status:

* [x] Implement
* [x] Reproduce
* [x] Validate
* [x] Document

> Implemented as **HIGH-03** (database connectivity failure — simulated DB outage returns 503 across DB-backed routes when active). Reproduced + validated green.

---

### Scenario D004 — Regression After Repair

A proposed repair should intentionally pass some tests while breaking another behavior.

Expected:

```text
Patch
 ↓
Sandbox
 ↓
Regression detected
 ↓
Patch rejected
```

Status:

* [ ] Implement
* [ ] Reproduce
* [ ] Validate
* [ ] Document

> Not implemented as a discrete fault in this round. This is the Demo 2 / Demo 3 concern (bad-candidate rejection + rollback after a regression), which is exercised by the candidate-selection/rollback workflow rather than a single injectable fault. Deferred to the demo-pipeline work.

---

## 13.4 Self-Healing Integration Readiness

Do not implement the entire AI system inside BuildHub during the initial application build.

Instead, expose clean interfaces for future integration.

The eventual system should be able to:

```text
Monitor BuildHub
       ↓
Receive incident
       ↓
Inspect logs
       ↓
Inspect application state
       ↓
Identify source files
       ↓
Generate patch
       ↓
Run tests
       ↓
Request approval
       ↓
Apply patch
       ↓
Restart
       ↓
Verify
       ↓
Rollback if necessary
```

---

### 13.4.1 Error Data Contract

Define a consistent incident representation.

Conceptually:

```text
Incident
├── id
├── timestamp
├── severity
├── component
├── endpoint
├── error_type
├── message
├── stack_trace
├── request_id
└── metadata
```

---

### 13.4.2 Validation Contract

Define a consistent way for the future repair system to determine:

```text
PASS
FAIL
UNKNOWN
```

Validation should eventually support:

```text
Unit tests
API tests
UI tests
Regression tests
Security checks
Health checks
```

---

# 14. Phase 10 — Final Integration + Demo

The final project should support three primary demonstrations.

---

## 14.1 Demo 1 — Easy Repair

```text
Normal BuildHub
      ↓
Inject typo/undefined variable
      ↓
Application failure
      ↓
AI detects
      ↓
AI proposes repair
      ↓
Validation
      ↓
Human approval
      ↓
Patch
      ↓
Recovery
```

Goal:

Demonstrate the basic self-healing loop.

---

## 14.2 Demo 2 — Bad AI Repair

```text
Incident
   ↓
Multiple candidate fixes
   ↓
Candidate A
Candidate B
Candidate C
   ↓
Sandbox testing
   ↓
Bad candidate rejected
   ↓
Correct candidate selected
   ↓

```

Goal:

Demonstrate that the system does not blindly trust AI-generated code.

---

## 14.3 Demo 3 — Failed Repair + Rollback

```text
Incident
   ↓
Fix generated
   ↓
Approval
   ↓
Patch deployed
   ↓
Regression detected
   ↓
Rollback
   ↓
Application restored
```

Goal:

Demonstrate safe recovery rather than simple code generation.

# 15. Final Self-Healing Test Matrix

Eventually BuildHub should support:

| Category  | Scenario             | Target              | Status |

# 16. Performance Baseline

Before self-healing experiments, establish a baseline.

Measure:

```text
Average API latency
Error rate
Request throughput
Database response time
Frontend load time where practical
```

Store baseline measurements.

These will later allow comparison before/after failure and recovery.

# 18. Current Project Status

## Current Phase

**Phase 10 — Final Integration + Demo** (implementation + validation complete; roadmap corrected to the agreed 10 phases — Following/Notifications/Search are out of scope)

## Current Task

**Phase 10 complete: real iterative self-healing engine (evidence → Coder/Critic/Judge rounds → risk → patch → live validation → RESOLVED/ROLLED_BACK; HIGH-risk requires human approval → apply) on top of the Phase 9 fault-injection sandbox, plus the Phase 10 learning loop (repair memory, normalized RL experiences, inspectable reward policy, RL dataset/visualization exports, evaluation harness, Learning dashboard, operator AI chat console) — validated by `scripts/verify-self-healing.mjs` (80/80) + `scripts/e2e_phase9_full.py` (64/64) + new `scripts/e2e_phase10_learning.py` (50/50, incl. a real HIGH-01 approval → apply+validate flow), plus regressions (verify-observability 28/28 clean, verify-security 32/32, verify-posts-projects 88/88), all lint/typecheck/build clean. Phase 9 engine + Phase 10 learning loop are complete.**

**Telegram alert-delivery overhaul complete (ADR-016): every alert now flows from real persisted data through a hardened IPv4-forced transport (fixed the `api.telegram.org` IPv6 `ETIMEDOUT`); the initial `INCIDENT` alert fires at incident creation (`sendIncidentAlert` in `security.ts`/`repair/ingest.ts`), `ESCALATION` fires after AI analysis, HIGH-risk-approval and `FINAL_SUMMARY` terminal messages use canonical builders in `lib/server/notifications/summary.ts`; delivery is an append-only log (SENT/FAILED/SKIPPED_DUPLICATE, permanent dedupe — no `@@unique(incidentId,type)`); delivery state surfaced in `GET /api/security/status` (connectivity + lastDelivery + lastIncident), a new SSE feed (`/api/security/events`), incident detail + Overview Telegram cards, PDF sections 6.5/6.6, and the AI chat system prompt. New scripts `scripts/test-telegram-integration.mjs` + `scripts/e2e_telegram_notifications.py`; docs `frontend/TELEGRAM_ALERTING.md`. `npx tsc --noEmit` + `npx eslint` clean.**

**Canonical incident briefing complete (ADR-017): a single `buildIncidentBrief(incidentId)` (`lib/server/notifications/brief.ts`) now powers every incident surface — TELEGRAM `INCIDENT` (10 sections, attack-aware) / LOW-MEDIUM `ESCALATION` AUTO-APPLY plans / `HIGH_RISK_APPROVAL_REQUIRED` (PROCEED/REJECT + 5-min expiry) / terminal `FINAL_SUMMARY` (RESOLVED/ROLLED_BACK/REJECTED/EXPIRED/AI_REPAIR_FAILED + System Health/Cyber Score/Site Risk), the incident-detail terminal card, PDF §6.6, and the AI chat context (with the explicit "Telegram delivery failed." phrase); errors/approvals/rollbacks render honestly from persisted facts with one SENT per (incident,type) and a 1-alert progression budget; SSE now streams a `lifecycle` feed (incidents/events/agentRuns/approvals/repairs) into the Overview "Incident Lifecycle" card; REJECT/EXPIRY finalize incidents with rejected/expired terminal summaries and `consumeApproval` runs after apply in both terminal branches. New `scripts/test-incident-briefing.mjs` (17 Teleind checks — 17/17 against real persisted SENT messages; pre-revision legacy alerts excluded by content signature) and `scripts/e2e_telegram_notifications.py` extended to run the MEDIUM-01 repair (ESCALATION + FINAL_SUMMARY SENT rows, dedupe, terminal card, lifecycle feed, PDF, chat) — live on an operator-authenticated TEST-mode server. `npx tsc --noEmit` + `npx eslint` clean.**

# 19. Active Tasks

Only tasks currently being worked on should appear here.

```text
[x] Phase 10 (Final Integration + Demo): iterative self-healing repair engine (CBDC evidence → up to 3 Coder/Critic/Judge rounds → deterministic risk → verified candidate → real HTTP validation probe → RESOLVED/ROLLED_BACK; HIGH risk gated behind a `repairAttemptId`-bound approval that continues to apply on PROCEED) with hermetic TEST-provider scenarios; fault → incident ingestion on activation + `/api/faults/random`; Phase 10 learning loop (memory, RL experiences, reward policy, dataset/visualization exports, evaluation harness, Learning dashboard, Security console chat); full upgrade of `verify-self-healing.mjs` (80/80) + `e2e_phase9_full.py` (64/64) + new `e2e_phase10_learning.py` (50/50).
[x] Telegram alert-delivery overhaul (ADR-016): IPv4-forced transport, initial INCIDENT alert at creation, ESCALATION after AI analysis, canonical HIGH-approval + FINAL_SUMMARY builders, append-only delivery log with permanent dedupe, delivery state in status/SSE/detail/Overview/PDF/chat, scripts `test-telegram-integration.mjs` + `e2e_telegram_notifications.py`, doc `TELEGRAM_ALERTING.md`.
[x] Canonical incident briefing (ADR-017): single `buildIncidentBrief` powers Telegram (attack-aware INCIDENT / LOW-MEDIUM auto-apply ESCALATION / HIGH_RISK_APPROVAL_REQUIRED PROCEED-REJECT / per-final-state FINAL_SUMMARY), detail terminal card, PDF §6.6, and AI chat (incl. "Telegram delivery failed." phrasing); REJECT/EXPIRY finalized with terminal summaries + `consumeApproval` on both branches; SSE `lifecycle` event + Overview "Incident Lifecycle" card; `test-incident-briefing.mjs` (17/17) + extended `e2e_telegram_notifications.py` (36/36).
[x] Final validation + demo coverage: lint/tsc/build clean; `test-telegram-integration.mjs` 32/32; `verify-self-healing.mjs` 80/80 + `verify-posts-projects.mjs` 88/88; demo scenarios B (HIGH PROCEED→RESOLVED) / C (REJECT→REJECTED) / D (EXPIRY→EXPIRED) via `demo_approval_scenarios.py` 40/40; briefing re-run 17/17 covering A/B/C/D/E/ATTACK; groq-mode server restored (provider `qwen/qwen3.8-27b`); all faults DEACTIVATED (active=0, FLOODING: NONE); section-27 PASS/FAIL report written. Root-caused + fixed real HIGH-01 login-guard wiring bug (`applyHigh01AuthBypass` was imported but never called).

# 20. Completed Tasks

Move completed major tasks here when appropriate.

```text
Frontend scaffold:
- [x] Next.js 16 + TypeScript + Tailwind v4 app created in `frontend/`.
- [x] ESLint + `tsc --noEmit` configured and clean.
- [x] `frontend/.env.example`, `frontend/README.md`, `.gitignore` in place.

Phase 1 — UI Foundation:
- [x] Design system (design tokens, dark mode, primitives) in `frontend/`.
- [x] Mock data layer + `lib/api` abstraction (`frontend/lib/`).
- [x] Authenticated app shell (sidebar, header, mobile nav).
- [x] All core pages (landing, auth, feed, post, profile, projects, project detail, notifications, settings, explore).
- [x] Loading / empty / error states including `app/(app)/loading.tsx` and `app/(app)/error.tsx`.
- [x] `npm run lint`, `npx tsc --noEmit`, `next build` all pass.

Phase 2 — Authentication:
- [x] PostgreSQL provisioned via Docker (`buildhub-pg`, `postgres:16-alpine`); `DATABASE_URL` managed via env.
- [x] Prisma 7 setup with `@prisma/adapter-pg` driver adapter; `prisma.config.ts` migration datasource.
- [x] `User` + `Session` models; initial migration `20260828184412_create_users_and_sessions` applied.
- [x] Registration API (`POST /api/auth/register`) with zod validation (username `[a-z0-9_]{3,20}`, email, password ≥ 8, confirm-password), argon2id hashing, duplicate detection (409 with field-specific message), auto-login.
- [x] Login API (`POST /api/auth/login`, email or username) with generic 401 on invalid credentials (no user-enumeration leak).
- [x] Logout API (`POST /api/auth/logout`, 204) that destroys the session row and clears the cookie.
- [x] Opaque DB-backed session tokens (SHA-256 hashed in DB), HttpOnly/secure/sameSite=lax cookie, 7-day TTL with expiry handling.
- [x] `GET /api/auth/me` returns the safe user or 401 (intended auth contract handled by the client as `user = null`).
- [x] Protected routes via server-component `app/(app)/layout.tsx` (redirects to `/login`); unauthenticated `/feed`, `/settings`, etc. redirect correctly.
- [x] `AuthProvider`/`useAuth` context; header/sidebar/mobile-nav wired to real auth (logout via dropdown).
- [x] Signup/login UI wired to real API.

Phase 3 — User Profiles:
- [x] Profile API (`GET /api/users/[username]`): username/name/bio/avatar/joined; email only returned to the owner; 404 for unknown user.
- [x] Profile update API (`PATCH /api/users/me`): session-derived owner, zod validation (name ≤ 80, bio ≤ 160, optional valid avatar URL), 401 unauthenticated.
- [x] Profile page rewired to real API with edit modal; settings page Profile section uses real auth state + `updateMyProfile`.

Phase 2/3 validation:
- [x] API integration checks via curl: register/login/me/logout/profile + validation + authz all verified against live dev server + DB.
- [x] Browser E2E (Playwright) 14/14 passed: signup→feed, login→feed, wrong-password generic error, logged-out redirects, profile edit→save→persist, logout, expected `/api/auth/me`+`/api/auth/login` 401s, no unhandled console exceptions.
- [x] `npm run lint`, `npx tsc --noEmit`, `next build` all pass cleanly.

Phase 4 — Posts:
- [x] Prisma `Post` model (author `Cascade`, optional `projectId` `SetNull`, `content`, `tags String[]`, timestamps, indexes) + migration `20260828192435_add_posts_and_projects` applied.
- [x] Post APIs: `POST/GET /api/posts` (GET cursor pagination, latest-first), `GET/PATCH/DELETE /api/posts/[id]` with ownership enforcement (403 for non-owners).
- [x] Post serializers (`lib/server/serializers.ts`: `AuthorDTO`, `PostDTO`, `ProjectDTO`); zod validation (content 1–1000, tags ≤ 5, tag rules) in `lib/validation.ts`.
- [x] Feed page rewired to real API (single feed; removed mock "Following" tab): composer with live avatar, project link select, tag editor, edit/delete menus, "View post" details.
- [x] Post details page with owner edit/delete (confirmation dialogs) and refetch on update.
- [x] Mock posts layer and orphaned components (`comment-list`, comment UI) removed.

Phase 5 — Projects (MVP):
- [x] Prisma `Project` model (owner `Cascade`, `name`, unique `slug`, optional `description`, `ProjectStatus` ACTIVE/COMPLETED/ARCHIVED default ACTIVE) in the same migration.
- [x] Project APIs: `POST/GET /api/projects` (GET supports `mine=1`), `GET/PATCH/DELETE /api/projects/[id]` (PATCH re-derives slug on rename; GET includes posts take 20).
- [x] Slug strategy in `lib/server/slugs.ts`: slugify, uniqueness suffix `-2`, `-3`, … with retry on Prisma P2002.
- [x] Project list page with Discover + My projects tabs, name search, status filter, create/edit/delete modals.
- [x] Project details page: header (owner, dates, post count, status badge), About, linked posts list, owner edit/delete; "Write a post" → `/feed`.
- [x] Deleting a project leaves its posts intact (unlinked via `SetNull`), verified in E2E.
- [x] Explore page + project cards use real `ProjectSummary` data.

Phase 4/5 validation:
- [x] `scripts/verify-posts-projects.mjs` committed: 46/46 API checks green (CRUD, validation, ownership 403s, auth 401s, pagination, tag/status/slug rules, project-delete unlinking) against live dev server + DB.
- [x] Browser E2E (Playwright) 36/36 passed: register→feed (empty composer disables publish), create project (+ empty-name inline error, My projects tab), linked post with tags → project detail, post detail + edit, cross-user (no owner menus for B), owner post delete, project rename to Completed + delete with post-survives-unlinked, profile rename + re-login regression, mobile 375px no-horizontal-overflow on `/feed`, `/projects`, `/posts`.
- [x] `npm run lint`, `npx tsc --noEmit`, `next build` all pass cleanly.

Phase 6 — Social Interactions (Likes + Comments):
- [x] Prisma `Like` model (`@@unique(userId, postId)`, cascade on post/user) + `Comment` model (post/author cascade, `content`) + back-relations on `User`/`Post`; migration `20260829040353_add_likes_and_comments` applied.
- [x] Like APIs: `POST/DELETE /api/posts/[id]/like` via `prisma.like.upsert` on compound key `userId_postId` (idempotent → no duplicate likes), returns `{ likeCount, likedByMe }`; 401 unauthenticated, 404 unknown post.
- [x] Comment APIs: `GET/POST /api/posts/[id]/comments` (list oldest-first, anonymous-readable) and `PATCH/DELETE /api/comments/[id]` with ownership enforcement (403 non-author, 401 anonymous, 404 unknown); zod validation (`content` 1–500, `COMMENT_CONTENT_MAX`).
- [x] Shared `postInclude(currentUserId?)` in `lib/server/serializers.ts`: every post query now carries `_count` and filtered per-user likes so `PostDTO` includes `likeCount`, `commentCount`, `likedByMe`; `CommentDTO` with `author` + `isMine`.
- [x] Frontend: `LikeButton` (optimistic local state, refetch on change) + comment count pill on post cards and post details; `CommentForm`/`CommentItem`/`CommentList` (edit inline, delete confirm, "edited" badge, skeleton/error/empty states).
- [x] `scripts/verify-posts-projects.mjs` extended to 78/78 API checks green (like/unlike idempotency, per-user `likedByMe`, comment CRUD + validation + cross-user ownership 403/401/404, `commentCount` persistence).
- [x] Browser E2E (Playwright) 28/28 passed (Phase 6 + Phase 4/5 regression): like/unlike toggle on feed & details, empty comment disables submit, comment create/edit/"edited"/delete → empty state, cross-user B can like + comment but has no owner menus and cannot edit/delete A's post or comment, post + project edit persistence, project delete leaves post unlinked, orphan post renders, B publishes own post, mobile 375px no-horizontal-overflow on `/feed`, `/posts/[id]`, `/projects`.
- [x] `npm run lint`, `npx tsc --noEmit`, `next build` all pass cleanly.

Phase 7 — Testing + Observability (final scope: structured logging + observability domain + command center; see §11.5–11.12):
- [x] Structured logging (`lib/server/logger.ts`) persisting INFO/WARN/ERROR rows with `requestId` correlation; auth failure/success instrumentation; no secrets logged.
- [x] Observability domain: Prisma `Incident`, `IncidentEvent`, `AgentRun`, `Approval`, `LogEvent`; incident/log seeding is idempotent (keyed on INC-00021) and resettable (`scripts/reset-observability.mjs`, deletes rows + reseeds).
- [x] Deterministic scoring contract (ADR-012): 24h window, severity risk/cyber weights, verbal penalty caps; seeded baseline risk 72 / cyber 94 / health 98 / 2 active, verified programmatically (45/45) in `scripts/verify-observability.mjs`.
- [x] Security findings (detection only): auth-failure burst (≥3, HIGH), server-error spike (≥3, HIGH), not-found burst (≥4, MEDIUM), invalid-request per route (≥5, MEDIUM), route-frequency (≥24, LOW; self-telemetry routes excluded).
- [x] APIs: `GET /api/health` (public, healthy/degraded/unavailable), `GET /api/incidents` (list + status/severity filtering), `GET /api/incidents/[id]` (timeline/logs/agentRuns/approvals/previous-similar), `POST /api/incidents/[id]/report` (pdfkit PDF, observed facts vs simulated AI analysis separated), `GET /api/logs`, `GET /api/observability/summary`.
- [x] AI Command Center UI (`app/(command)` route group at `/ai`): Overview w/ auto-refresh, Incidents list + detail, Live Logs, AI Pipeline (simulated Fixer→Critic→Judge preview only — no AI provider invoked, no auto-fixes), History, Reports; hardened auth gate (guest → login), mobile drawer, no 4xx/5xx in E2E, no console errors, 375px no-overflow.
- [x] App nav instrumentation: Command Center link in sidebar + mobile nav (authed only).
- [x] Validation recorded in §24 change log (6): lint + tsc + build clean; `verify-observability.mjs` 45/45; `e2e_phase7_full.py` 25/25; Phase 6 regression `e2e_phase6_full.py` 44/44; `verify-posts-projects.mjs` 88/88.

Phase 8 — Security + Attack Detection:
- [x] Baseline & schema (ADR-013, no-fake-data): migration `20260829104339_phase8_security` adds `SecurityFinding` (fingerprint-unique, ruleId, severity, signal JSON, status), `TelegramNotification`, `Incident.detectedBy`, `AgentRun.model` + `output` + `error`; seeded demo observability gated behind `SEED_OBSERVABILITY=1`; `reset-observability.mjs` wipe-only; `verify-observability.mjs` clean baseline 28/28.
- [x] `lib/server` modules: `risk.ts` (deterministic phase-8 scoring + tier thresholds), `security.ts` (findings ingest/correlate/dedupe, incident promotion, `requireSecurityOperator()`, Telegram tiers), `ai.ts` (real Groq Fixer/Critic/Judge, FAILED statuses + "AI ANALYSIS UNAVAILABLE", never fake output), `telegram.ts`, `routes-map.ts`.
- [x] API routes: `POST /api/security/findings`, `POST /api/security/ingest`, `POST /api/security/run` (mode="REAL"), `GET /api/security/status`, `POST /api/telegram/test` — live-tested with 401/403 gates.
- [x] Analyzer: `security_log_analyzer.py` (pure stdlib, 8 detector rules) + `test_security_log_analyzer.py` 12/12 + `dump-log-events.mjs` (contract v2).
- [x] Command Center UI live REAL pipeline + Security view (`/ai/security`), operator actions, 3D `security-network`, clean banner, Groq Online/Unavailable status.
- [x] PDF reports label REAL runs + section 6.5 Alert Delivery (Telegram).
- [x] Verification tooling (Step 7): `verify-security.mjs` (32/32), `e2e_phase8_full.py`, `verify-observability.mjs` (28/28), `PHASE8_SECURITY_COMMANDS.md`.
- [x] Full validation chain (Step 8): lint + tsc + build clean; security cohort 32/32; analyzer 12/12; clean-state `/ai` checks pass.

Phase 9 — AI Self-Healing Engine:
- [x] Fault registry + injection core (`lib/server/fault-injection.ts`): 9 faults (LOW-01..03, MEDIUM-01..03, HIGH-01..03) with activate/deactivate/deactivate-all, guarded by `FAULT_INJECTION_ENABLED=true`.
- [x] Fault handlers (`fault-injection-handlers.ts`): LOW-01 (TypeError), LOW-02 (field typo), MEDIUM-01 (POST 500), MEDIUM-02 (GET 500), HIGH-03 (DB-outage 503); LOW-03 via dynamic server-side validation; MEDIUM-03 (project authz inversion) + HIGH-01 (login bypass) + HIGH-02 (project authz bypass) wired into their routes.
- [x] Faults API (`POST/GET /api/faults`) with operator gate + action (activate/deactivate/deactivate-all); `faultId` optional for deactivate-all.
- [x] Approval system: `lib/server/approval.ts` state machine (PENDING/APPROVED/REJECTED/EXPIRED/CONSUMED), Approval model + `ApprovalStatus` enum + migration `20260829170000_phase9_approvals_and_telegram` + follow-up `20260830000000_fix_approval_status_enum` (cast `approvals.status` text → enum); `POST /api/approvals/create`, `POST /api/approvals/proceed`, `POST /api/incidents/[id]/apply-patch`.
- [x] Telegram delivery log — superseded by ADR-016 (2026-08-30 (8)): original unique `(incidentId, type)` + `lastSentAt` cooldown was replaced by an append-only log with permanent per-`(incidentId, type)` dedupe (`SENT`/`FAILED`/`SKIPPED_DUPLICATE`, no `@@unique`).
- [x] Fixer/Critic/Judge pipeline surface + AI chat (`/api/ai/chat`) + repair memory (`/api/ai/memory`) + 3D viz (`/api/ai/visualization`) endpoints exposed.
- [x] Self-healing verification: `verify-self-healing.mjs` 67/67 + `e2e_phase9_full.py` 64/64 (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH trigger + deactivate, approval/apply-patch reachability, telegram dedupe, dashboard, chat API, 3D, mobile). Docs: `AI_CODEBASE_MAP.md`, `PHASE9_FAULT_TEST_PLAN.md`.

Phase 9 — Iterative self-healing engine (replaces the single-pass analysis surface for fault incidents):
- [x] Schema + migrations (`20260830090000_phase9_iterative_and_phase10_learning`, `20260830091000_phase9_incident_metadata`): `AgentName CODER`, `AgentRun.round`/`kind`, `IncidentStatus` extended, `Incident.metadata`, `RepairAttempt`, `PatchRecord`, `RepairMemory`, `RepairExperience` (+ indexes/cascades).
- [x] `lib/server/repair/` engine: `conversation.ts` (iterative CBDC Coder/Critic/Judge, stop rules, sandboxed `sourceContext` with TEST-only fault hints), `evidence.ts` (error location/sanitisation), `canonical.ts` (oracle baseline fix decision), `validation.ts` (candidate guardrails), `patch-engine.ts`/`file-applicator.ts` (real file writes + backup/rollback), `risk.ts` (deterministic risk), `events.ts`, `ingest.ts` (`createFaultIncident`, risk weights), `engine.ts` (`runSelfHealingRepair`, `continueApprovedRepair`, `finalizeFailure`, `persistLearning`, `notifyRepair`, `loadFinalCandidate`).
- [x] `/api/security/run` dispatches fault incidents (`metadata.faultId`) to the engine; legacy security incidents keep the Phase 8 analysis pipeline. `runPipelineSchema` accepts an optional `scenario` forwarded only to the hermetic TEST provider.
- [x] Fault lifecycle (ADR-015): activation applies the fault patch and creates a fault incident; `/api/faults/random` picks one inactive fault; `isFaultGaurded` runtime guard with disarm/rearm; honest `AI_REPAIR_FAILED` stage reporting.
- [x] Approval binding: `createApproval` accepts `repairAttemptId` (crypto `randomInt` ids with collision retry; FK errors propagate cleanly), `transitionApproval` fixes the non-unique compound update; `/api/approvals/proceed` continues a bound approval (apply → validate → consume) and never fabricates a patch for legacy approvals.

Phase 10 — Final Integration + Demo (learning loop + demo surfaces):
- [x] `lib/server/learning/memory.ts`: reward policy (env-tunable `REPAIR_REWARD_*`), `recordRepairMemory`/`recordRepairExperience` (normalized `(state, action, reward, nextState, terminal)` from real attempts), `computeLearningMetrics`, `computeEvaluationStats`, `exportRlDataset`, visualization aggregates.
- [x] AI API routes: `/api/ai/chat` (TEST short-circuits, REAL calls provider), `/api/ai/memory`, `/api/ai/learning`, `/api/ai/rl-dataset`, `/api/ai/evaluate`, `/api/ai/experiences`, `/api/ai/visualization`.
- [x] Frontend: `/ai/learning` Learning dashboard (metrics, reward policy, evaluation harness, risk distribution, experience timeline, RL dataset preview) + nav; Security page Self-Healing Console chat; incident detail live transcript (polling while active, repair attempt + patch banner, round-grouped conversation UI; ApprovalDTO friendly decision/outcome fields; fix for a pre-existing client/server ApprovalDTO mismatch).
- [x] Scripts/doc: `verify-self-healing.mjs` upgraded to the fault → incident → engine path (80/80); new `scripts/e2e_phase10_learning.py` (50/50); `frontend/PHASE10_LEARNING_COMMANDS.md`.

```

Do not use this section for minor implementation details.

---

### ADR-001 — Frontend stack: Next.js 16 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS v4

Decision:
- Use Next.js 16 (App Router, Turbopack), React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v4 for the frontend.

Reason:
- App Router enables per-page loading/error boundaries and server components; TS gives type safety; Tailwind v4 provides a CSS-first, token-based design system. Matches the project's need for a realistic modern production UI.

Alternatives considered:
- Vite + React (no routing/SEO conveniences and fewer Next 16 idioms), no-Util-UI component libraries (kept the design system lean and dependency-light).

Impact:
- Mock data layer in `lib/api` mirrors future API shapes; React 19/Next 16 rules require notes like `params` being a `Promise`.

Date: 2026-08-28

---

### ADR-002 — Defer unit-test runner for the UI foundation

Decision:
- Do not add a unit-test framework (e.g. Vitest/Jest) during Phase 1. Validate via `next build`, `tsc --noEmit`, ESLint, and manual/Playwright visual checks.

Reason:
- Phase 1 is UI-only with mock data; wiring a unit-test runner now is premature against AGENTS rules (avoid unnecessary dependencies). Webapp testing (Playwright) can cover visual/functional checks.

Alternatives considered:
- Adding Vitest immediately.

Impact:
- Revisit and select a testing framework during Phase 10 (Testing) or when backend logic arrives; `AGENTS.md` test mandates are met for Phase 1 by build/type/lint/visual validation.

Date: 2026-08-28

---

### ADR-003 — Feed route is `/feed`, marketing landing owns `/`

Decision:
- The authenticated feed lives at `/feed` (`app/(app)/feed/page.tsx`) and the public marketing landing page owns `/` (`app/page.tsx`). The shell's logo and "Home" nav item link to `/feed`.

Reason:
- Two `page.tsx` files (`app/page.tsx` and `app/(app)/page.tsx`) both resolved to `/`, so Next.js serially served the landing page and the feed was unreachable. Route groups contribute no URL segment, so the feed needs an explicit path.

Alternatives considered:
- Removing the landing page (lost the public entry point), keeping the feed at `/` (lost the landing).

Impact:
- Unique, reachable routes for both the marketing page and the authenticated home; nav helpers updated accordingly.

Date: 2026-08-28

---

### ADR-004 — Opaque DB-backed session tokens (no JWT)

Decision:
- Authentication uses opaque, random 256-bit session tokens (base64url) stored hashed (SHA-256) in a `Session` table, delivered to the browser as an HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite=Lax cookie (`buildhub_session`, 7-day TTL). No JWT.

Reason:
- Server-side sessions allow immediate, guaranteed logout (row delete), expiry control, and revocation without key/issuer management. Storing only the token hash protects against DB-leak session hijacking. Avoids JWT trade-offs (revocation, secret rotation).

Alternatives considered:
- Stateless JWT (revocation/blacklist complexity), signed cookies with raw payload (replay/tampering surface).

Impact:
- Requires a DB lookup per authenticated request (acceptable at this scale). `safeUser` strips `passwordHash` from every response.

Date: 2026-08-29

---

### ADR-005 — Prisma 7 driver-adapter setup for PostgreSQL

Decision:
- Use Prisma 7 with the `@prisma/adapter-pg` driver adapter (`PrismaPg`) wired through a `PrismaPg` client; the `url` datasource property is removed from `schema.prisma` and supplied via `DATABASE_URL` env (loaded in `prisma.config.ts` for migrations and in `lib/server/db.ts` for runtime).

Reason:
- Prisma 7 removed `url` from the schema datasource and requires a driver adapter (`@prisma/adapter-pg` + `pg`) for the generated `PrismaClient`. This also enables future self-healing observability to connect to the same engine. PostgreSQL runs in Docker (`buildhub-pg`, `postgres:16-alpine`).

Alternatives considered:
- Database URL embedded in schema (rejected: Prisma 7 breaking change), raw SQL without an ORM (rejected: no migrations/types).

Impact:
- Unique-constraint errors surface P2002 with the constraint nested under `meta.driverAdapterError.cause.constraint.index` (not `meta.target`), which `handleApiError` parses to return field-specific 409s. Migration tooling uses `prisma.config.ts`.

Date: 2026-08-29

---

### ADR-006 — Consistent API response & error envelope

Decision:
- API endpoints return `{ user: ... }` on success and `{ error: message }` with the appropriate HTTP status on failure (400 validation, 401 unauthenticated, 403 unauthorized, 404 not found, 409 conflict, 500 default). Never exposes `passwordHash` or internal stack traces.

Reason:
- Gives the frontend and the future self-healing system predictable, structured responses to detect, correlate, and classify failures. Login failures return one generic message ("Unable to sign in...") to avoid account enumeration; duplicate registration returns field-specific 409s summarised from the Prisma violation.

Alternatives considered:
- Ad-hoc per-route errors (inconsistent), leaking validation/DB internals (rejected on security/consistency grounds).

Impact:
- A single `errorResponse`/`handleApiError`/`firstZodIssue` helper set in `lib/server/response.ts` keeps behavior uniform and testable.

Date: 2026-08-29

---

### ADR-007 — Referential actions for posts and projects

Decision:
- `Post.authorId` → `onDelete: Cascade` (deleting a user removes their posts). `Post.projectId` → `onDelete: SetNull` (deleting a project keeps the posts, now unlinked). `Project.ownerId` → `onDelete: Cascade`.

Reason:
- A project is an entity that can be removed without destroying its update history; posts that referenced it remain valid content, just unlinked. Conversely a post cannot meaningfully exist without its author, so author deletion removes them.

Alternatives considered:
- `Restrict` (blocks user deletion; complicates account deletion UX), `Cascade` on `projectId` (loses post content when a project is deleted).

Impact:
- Project delete sweeps `projectId` to null on linked posts; the UI keeps rendering the post and drops the project link. Verified in the API verifier and browser E2E (orphan post survives project deletion).

Date: 2026-08-29

---

### ADR-008 — Project slug uniqueness strategy

Decision:
- Project slugs are derived from a lowercased/slugified project name (`lib/server/slugs.ts`). On a unique-violation (Prisma P2002) the slug is re-derived with a numeric suffix starting at 2 (first duplicate becomes `...-2`, next `...-3`), retried until available.

Reason:
- Keeps URLs readable and stable for the initial name; avoids racing to reserve a base slug. Starting the suffix at 2 matches the plan's documented behavior and avoids the odd-looking `-1`.

Alternatives considered:
- Base slug + auto-increment suffix from 1, server-generated UUID slugs (unreadable), no slug at all (id-only URLs).

Impact:
- `PATCH /api/projects/[id]` re-derives a new slug when the name changes, so slugs follow renames rather than breaking; id-based `[id]` routing keeps links stable regardless.

Date: 2026-08-29

---

### ADR-009 — Like uniqueness via composite constraint + idempotent upsert

Decision:
- `Like` has `@@unique([userId, postId])` in the schema, and the like API uses `prisma.like.upsert` on the generated compound key (`userId_postId`) for like, `deleteMany` for unlike.

Reason:
- The database constraint makes duplicate likes structurally impossible, and the upsert makes like/unlike idempotent under retries (e.g. client double-clicks). Because the self-healing validation pipeline compares DB state, a query rather than a pre-check avoids race windows.

Alternatives considered:
- Application-layer existence check then create (race window), `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` via raw SQL (kept Prisma-only).

Impact:
- `likeCount` derived from `_count.likes`; per-user state via filtered `likes` include. Both are simple, indexed, and consistent.

Date: 2026-08-29

---

### ADR-010 — Comment referential actions

Decision:
- `Comment.postId` → `onDelete: Cascade` (deleting a post removes its comments) and `Comment.authorId` → `onDelete: Cascade` (deleting a user removes their comments).

Reason:
- A comment is meaningful only within its post and only authored by its user; orphaned comments would violate the delete-model guarantees the self-healing validator relies on.

Alternatives considered:
- `SetNull` on `postId` (orphaned "floating" comments), `Restrict` (blocks user/post deletion).

Impact:
- Post deletion sweeps comments; comment counts via `_count` stay consistent. Comment ownership (edit/delete) is enforced server-side with 403.

Date: 2026-08-29

---

### ADR-011 — Three.js hero on the landing page

Decision:
- The marketing landing page (`/`) uses a Three.js (`@react-three/fiber` v9 + `three`) floating-blocks hero rendered by `frontend/components/landing/hero-blocks.tsx`, with a CSS-only lattice fallback.

Reason:
- The user explicitly chose "Add Three.js floating blocks" (over a CSS-only hero) for a distinctive, non-template landing experience that also exercises WebGL for the future self-healing demo plane.

Gating:
- The 3D scene is only mounted on the client and only when WebGL is available, the pointer is not coarse/touch, viewport is > 640px, and `prefers-reduced-motion` is not set; otherwise the CSS lattice fallback renders. Server-rendered HTML and reduced-motion/mobile users always get the fallback, so motion-reduced and mobile visitors see a stable, static hero.

Impact:
- Added `three`, `@react-three/fiber@^9.7.0`, `@types/three` (dev). Shared materials are memoized once; pointer parallax eases rotation inside `useFrame`. Verified via browser check: desktop renders a `<canvas>` with no console errors, mobile/reduced-motion gate it off, no horizontal overflow. The `switch` statement is replaced by a single memoized material array to keep the module client-only and small.

Date: 2026-08-29

---

### ADR-012 — Observability scores are pure functions of database/infrastructure state

Decision:
- All command-center scores (`riskScore`, `cyberSafetyScore`, `systemHealth`, `activeIncidents`) are computed deterministically at read time from persisted state (Incident/LogEvent rows + live infrastructure probes) using a documented 24-hour window, specific severity weights, and capped penalty terms. The seeded database therefore always yields the exact demo baseline: risk 72, cyber 94, health 98, 2 active incidents.
- The formula, weights, caps, and hazard thresholds (auth failures ≥3, not-found ≥4, server errors ≥3, invalid requests ≥5 per route, route frequency ≥24, api-error healthy ≤6) are constants in `lib/server/observability.ts` and verified by `scripts/verify-observability.mjs`.
- Security findings are detection-only in Phase 7: they surface in the UI/reports but do not block, fix, or auto-approve anything. The AI Fixer → Critic → Judge pipeline is a clearly-labelled simulation preview; no external AI provider is invoked.

Reason:
- The future self-healing system needs stable, reproducible signals: the same state must always produce the same numbers so failures and repairs can be validated and demoed deterministically (see AGENTS.md §61–62).

Alternatives considered:
- Storing computed scores in the DB (rejected: stale by definition, hides recomputation bugs).
- Calling an external AI/LLM for analysis now (rejected: outside Phase 7 scope, adds nondeterminism and dependency on provider availability for the demo).

Impact:
- New tables `Incident`, `IncidentEvent`, `AgentRun`, `Approval`, `LogEvent`; observability API layer; `/ai` command center; `pdfkit` added for reports; auth/login logging added; seed extended with 4 demo incidents + 30 log events (idempotent, resettable).

Date: 2026-08-29

---

### ADR-013 — Phase 8 detection transport + clean no-fake-data baseline

Decision:
- Phase 8 replaced the seeded Phase 7 demo baseline with a clean, real-data baseline. `prisma/seed.mjs` no longer creates demo incidents/logs unless `SEED_OBSERVABILITY=1` (Phase 7 regression escape hatch); `scripts/reset-observability.mjs` is wipe-only; `scripts/verify-observability.mjs` asserts risk 0 / cyber 100 / health 100 / active 0 (28/28). This deliberately supersedes the ADR-012 demo numbers.
- Detection transport is: `scripts/dump-log-events.mjs` (Node + Prisma, reuses existing `pg`) dumps real `LogEvent` rows as JSON → `frontend/scripts/security_log_analyzer.py` (pure Python stdlib — no psycopg/pip deps) reads that JSON and emits structured findings → `POST /api/security/findings` (session + `SECURITY_OPERATOR_USERNAMES` gate; zod-validated) ingests them. Next.js owns fingerprint dedupe, incident creation, the deterministic risk engine, real Groq analysis and Telegram.
- Rule list (auth-failure-burst, repeated-401, repeated-403, not-found-burst, server-error-spike, invalid-request-burst, request-frequency-anomaly, endpoint-abuse-pattern, repeated-unauthorized-mutations) lives in the Python analyzer with documented windows/thresholds; Next.js mirrors them for display. No client-IP capture (BuildHub logs request IDs, not IPs).
- AI honesty: any real Groq/network failure marks the AgentRun FAILED and the UI shows "AI ANALYSIS UNAVAILABLE — <reason>"; the pipeline keeps operating and Telegram still fires. Candidate fixes are text-only for human review — nothing is auto-applied in Phase 8.

Reason:
- The user's no-fake-data rule conflicts with hardcoded demo incidents/scores; Phase 8 must detect real anomalies from real BuildHub logs so the future self-healing engine has genuine evidence. Keeping ingest secret-less and operator-gated avoids new credential infrastructure.

Alternatives considered:
- Analyzer connecting directly to Postgres (rejected: needs psycopg dependency that is not installed; JSON dump keeps Python stdlib-only), direct Next.js detection without Python (rejected: user explicitly specified the Python security log analyzer).

Impact:
- New tables/fields (migration `20260829104339_phase8_security`), new `/api/security/*` + `/api/telegram/test` surface, new `lib/server/{risk,security,ai,telegram,routes-map}.ts`, analyzer + unit tests, `.env.example` additions. Phase 7 tooling baselines updated; e2e Phase 7 rewritten for clean state during Phase 8.

Date: 2026-08-29

---

### ADR-014 — Iterative self-healing engine with honest candidate lifecycle

Decision:
- Fault-triggered incidents (incident `metadata.faultId`) run a real iterative repair loop instead of the Phase 8 single-pass analytics pipeline: CBDC evidence generation → up to 3 Coder/Critic/Judge conversation rounds → deterministic risk classification (fault risk weights LOW 10 / MED 25 / HIGH 60 / CRIT 90) → structural candidate verification → patch application with real HTTP validation probes → RESOLVED or ROLLED_BACK; HIGH risk requires a human approval first (`repairAttemptId`-bound approval, apply only after PROCEED).
- Provider separation (hermetic TEST vs REAL): `AI_PROVIDER=test` + `SELF_HEALING_TEST_MODE` + non-production short-circuits the provider to deterministic `scenario` contracts (`accept-round-1|2|3`, `reject-all`, `judge-reject`); Groq never sees scenario or fault answers, so hermetic e2e never fakes production. Model/network failures are recorded as `AI_UNAVAILABLE` / `AI_REPAIR_FAILED`, never fabricated.
- Result `stage` reports the honest terminal stage (`RESOLVED`, `ROLLED_BACK`, `WAITING_APPROVAL`, `AI_REPAIR_FAILED`, …), not the pre-repair status.

Reason:
- The Phase 8 pipeline analysed but never patched; the demo scenarios (Detect → Fix → Approval → Validation → Rollback) require a real, deterministic, approval-gated repair loop on real files.

Alternatives considered:
- Side-effect-free analysis only (insufficient for demos), unconditional auto-apply (unsafe), hand-injected canonical fixes (violates no-fake-data).

Impact:
- New migration (`20260830090000_phase9_iterative_and_phase10_learning`, `20260830091000_phase9_incident_metadata`), `frontend/lib/server/repair/*` engine, `/api/faults/random`, approval binding, `/api/security/run` dispatch.

Date: 2026-08-30

---

### ADR-015 — Fault lifecycle: patch-on-activate, disarm/rearm guards, incident ingestion

Decision:
- `POST /api/faults {faultId}` activates the fault **and** creates a fault incident (`createFaultIncident` composes risk/metadata/errorCode from the documented fault config); the repair engine then patches the real handler file, disarms the runtime guard so live probes observe the restored behaviour, and rolls back (rearm) when validation fails. `isFaultGaurded` (name preserved intentionally) gates runtime triggering; disarm/rearm stays reversible and in-memory; `deactivate-all` clears guards.
- Old per-fault trigger loops in the verification scripts now flow through the fault → incident → engine path; `/api/faults/random` selects one inactive fault for a single-shot random activation.

Reason:
- Deterministic, reproducible faults that produce real incidents with a documented expected root cause are the substrate the engine (and future self-healing platform) needs; random injection must stay explicit, isolated, and fully reversible.

Alternatives considered:
- Keeping faults as pure runtime guards without incident ingestion (no repair anchor point).

Impact:
- `frontend/lib/server/repair/ingest.ts`, slimmed `/api/faults` GET, `/api/security/run` metadata dispatch.

Date: 2026-08-30

---

### ADR-016 — Append-only Telegram delivery log with hardened IPv4 transport

Decision:
- All Telegram rows are write-once delivery records (no in-place updates, no `@@unique(incidentId, type)`). Permanent per-`(incidentId, type)` dedupe is enforced at send time by `telegramAlreadySent()`; a repeat attempt records a `SKIPPED_DUPLICATE` row ("Duplicate delivery skipped…") and never sends. `SENT` is recorded only on a real `ok:true` Telegram response with a `message_id`; when Telegram is unconfigured the send is a no-op that persists nothing.
- Transport is direct `node:https` to `api.telegram.org:443` forced to IPv4 (`family: 4` + `autoSelectFamily: false`), `rejectUnauthorized: true`, 12s timeout, retry up to `MAX_SEND_ATTEMPTS=3` only on network/429/5xx (never 400/401/403); rejected tokens sanitized. Tokens are never logged/stored/echoed.
- Message content is built canonically in `lib/server/notifications/summary.ts` from persisted facts (`INCIDENT` initial alert at incident creation, `ESCALATION` after AI analysis, `HIGH_RISK_APPROVAL_REQUIRED` with candidate diff + expiry, `FINAL_SUMMARY` terminal via `sendIncidentTerminalSummary`). Delivery state is surfaced in `GET /api/security/status` (connectivity `getMe` + lastDelivery + lastIncident), a new authenticated SSE feed `/api/security/events` (snapshot + delivery events), the Overview/incident-detail Telegram cards, PDF sections 6.5/6.6, and the AI chat system prompt.

Reason:
- The original dedupe + cooldown approach produced silent drops and unreliable delivery; the append-only log makes every attempt honest audit state, keeps UI/PDF/SSE/chat consistent with what Telegram actually received, and the IPv4-forced socket fixes intermittent `api.telegram.org` AAAA `ETIMEDOUT` failures (`curl -4` worked while Node hung).

Alternatives considered:
- `@@unique([incidentId, type])` constraint (rejects: Prisma would surface P2002 and, with upsert, could swallow/hide repeat attempts, losing audit history; dedupe rules differ for incident-less TEST rows), app-level cooldown timestamps (rejected: racy, loses history of skipped sends).

Impact:
- Migration `20260830120000_add_telegram_summary_types` extends `NotificationType`/`DeliveryStatus` enums (`SKIPPED_DUPLICATE`, `HIGH_RISK_APPROVAL_REQUIRED`, `REPAIR_APPLIED`, `REPAIR_FAILED`, `ROLLBACK_COMPLETED`, `RECOVERY`, `FINAL_SUMMARY`) and adds indexes; `lib/server/telegram.ts` rewrite + new `lib/server/notifications/summary.ts`; `sendIncidentAlert` at promotion/ingest, ESCALATION after analysis; new SSE route + client `subscribeSecurityEvents`; observability DTO (`telegram.deliveries`, `terminalSummary`); PDF + AI-chat integration; verification scripts `scripts/test-telegram-integration.mjs`, `scripts/e2e_telegram_notifications.py`; docs `frontend/TELEGRAM_ALERTING.md`.

Date: 2026-08-30

### ADR-017 — One canonical incident brief for every alert surface

Decision:
- Add `buildIncidentBrief(incidentId)` (`lib/server/notifications/brief.ts`) as the **single persisted source of truth** for all incident-facing content: Telegram messages, the incident-detail terminal card, PDF section 6.6, and the AI chat context. The brief is assembled only from real `Incident`/`RepairAttempt`/`AgentRun`/`PatchRecord`/`Approval`/`TelegramNotification` rows; absent steps render `n/a` or `Pending AI analysis…`, never invented facts. Helpers: `isAttackIncident` (no `metadata.faultId` + `security-log-analyzer` detected-by), shared `parseProbeResult`, `approvalDecision`, `finalStateOf`.
- `lib/server/notifications/summary.ts` now builds every message from the brief: attack-aware `INCIDENT` (ten sections: PROBLEM, TRIGGER, ROOT CAUSE, LOCATION, AI ANALYSIS, PROPOSED FIX, CODE CHANGE, VALIDATION, RISK POLICY + ATTACK TELEMETRY), LOW/MEDIUM `ESCALATION` auto-apply plans (`sendRepairPlanMessage` before `applyCandidate`), `HIGH_RISK_APPROVAL_REQUIRED` with `PROCEED <id>` / `REJECT <id>` + 5-minute expiry, and terminal `FINAL_SUMMARY` per final state (RESOLVED / ROLLED_BACK / REJECTED / EXPIRED / AI_REPAIR_FAILED) with System Health / Cyber Score / Site Risk lines via a dependency-free `systemSnapshot()`.
- Approval outcomes surface terminal state without new enum values: REJECT/EXPIRY finalize the incident as `AI_REPAIR_FAILED` (canonical brief still reports REJECTED/EXPIRED final state); `approvals/proceed` writes an `IncidentEvent`, marks the attempt REJECTED, and sends the rejected/expired `FINAL_SUMMARY`; `continueApprovedRepair` calls `consumeApproval` in both RESOLVED and ROLLED_BACK branches.
- SSE `/api/security/events` gains a `lifecycle` event (initial snapshot + per-poll diffs of incidents/events/agentRuns/approvals/repairs) consumed by the Overview "Incident Lifecycle" card via `subscribeSecurityEvents({ onLifecycle })`.
- The AI chat (`POST /api/ai/chat`) context is built from the canonical brief of the latest incident; when the latest delivery FAILED the context states "Telegram delivery failed.".
- Message budget per incident: `INCIDENT` (1) → `ESCALATION` OR `HIGH_RISK_APPROVAL_REQUIRED` (1) → `FINAL_SUMMARY` (1).

Reason:
- Telegram, the dashboard, the PDF and the AI chat previously built content from overlapping-but-not-identical code paths (e.g. `buildPipelineUpdateMessage` vs terminal facts), so the same incident could be described differently across surfaces and old terminal logic ignored human decisions. One canonical brief guarantees "what Telegram received == what the UI/PDF/chat show" by construction, and honest risk/approval behavior is enforceable in a single place.

Alternatives considered:
- Persisting each surface's text snapshot separately (rejected: drift risk, no single oracle), exposing the raw brief in every API (rejected: leaks internal shape), date-based content checks in tests (rejected: brittle — the briefing test instead uses a content signature, `TRIGGER`, to exclude pre-revision legacy rows).

Impact:
- New `lib/server/notifications/brief.ts`; `summary.ts` rewritten (alert/repair-plan/approval/attack/terminal builders); `repair/engine.ts` (repair-plan ESCALATION + `consumeApproval`), `app/api/approvals/proceed/route.ts` (REJECT/EXPIRY terminal flow), `lib/server/security.ts` (attack analysis alert), `lib/server/observability.ts` (`IncidentTerminalDTO.finalState` widened to REJECTED/EXPIRED; terminal facts loaded for rejected/expired approvals), SSE route + `lib/api/security.ts` (`onLifecycle`, `LifecycleEventDTO`), Overview `Incident Lifecycle` card, incident-detail terminal labels, AI chat route. New `scripts/test-incident-briefing.mjs` (17 Teleind checks) + `e2e_telegram_notifications.py` extended to run the MEDIUM-01 repair (ESCALATION + FINAL_SUMMARY + terminal card + lifecycle feed). Docs: `frontend/TELEGRAM_ALERTING.md`, `AI_CODEBASE_MAP.md`. `npx tsc --noEmit` + `npx eslint` clean; briefing 17/17 against real persisted data (scenarios A + E live).

Date: 2026-08-30

```text
- `frontend/README.md` is stale: it still describes the Phase 1 "UI-only / mock data" state and its "Data" section contradicts the real DB-backed APIs. Not fixed in this phase (non-blocking, docs-only).
- The `notifications` page (`frontend/app/(app)/notifications/page.tsx`) is a static placeholder shell; the notifications feature is intentionally out of roadmap scope.
- Phase 7's simulated Fixer → Critic → Judge preview (ADR-012) has been replaced by the REAL Groq pipeline in Phase 8 (ADR-013); residual "Simulation mode." copy has been removed from the command center.
- The logs API returns all persisted log rows by default; the 24-hour scoring window applies to scores/findings and to the `from=24h` filter, so all-time and in-window counts can differ.
```

Do not silently expand scope to fix unrelated issues.

### 2026-08-31

Changed:
- Fixed MEDIUM-01 (and MEDIUM-02) `CODER_FAILED`/`AI_REPAIR_FAILED` so the fault-driven repair pipeline reliably reaches RESOLVED on the real Groq provider.
  - Root cause 1: `buildSourceContext` (`lib/server/repair/evidence.ts`) could not match the placeholder `originalCode` (`prisma.post.create({...})`) against the real file, so it inserted a `// FAULTED:` comment; the Coder then returned `proposedCode: ""`, which `parseCoder`/`verifyCandidate` rejected → `CODER_FAILED`. Fixed by (a) correcting MEDIUM-01/02 `originalCode` in `lib/server/fault-injection.ts` to the exact real blocks (throw now replaces `prisma.post.create` / `prisma.post.findMany`), (b) making the fallback insert the fault as a real statement instead of a comment, and (c) allowing a removal-type candidate (empty `proposedCode`) through `parseCoder` (conversation.ts) and `verifyCandidate` (patch-engine.ts) — the canonical oracle still gates correctness.
  - Root cause 2: the MEDIUM-01/LOW-01 validation probe sent a body-less `POST /api/posts` (→400, never 201), so the patch rolled back even after disarming. Fixed `lib/server/repair/validation.ts` to POST a healthy post body.
- On resolved incidents the engine now `deactivateFault(faultId)` (`lib/server/repair/engine.ts`, both auto- and approval-resolve branches) so the fault catalog returns to `active:false` (clean "0 active faults" demo end-state).
- Verified live on the running Groq server: MEDIUM-01 activates → Coder/Critic/Judge → candidate → canonical → disarm → probe 201 → VALIDATED → RESOLVED (patch `VALIDATED`, fault `active:false`); HIGH-01 → `WAITING_APPROVAL` (HIGH_RISK_APPROVAL_REQUIRED Telegram SENT) → PROCEED → approval consumed → RESOLVED; browser SSE live-update confirmed (dashboard shows the new INC ref and updates without a manual reload when a fault is triggered). Scripts: `verify-self-healing.mjs` 80/80, `test-telegram-integration.mjs` 32/32, `npx tsc --noEmit` exit 0, `npm run lint` 0 errors, `npm run build` green (built into a separate `.next-ci` distDir to avoid disrupting the running dev server, then removed).

Reason:
- The hackathon demo requires MEDIUM-01 to auto-repair deterministically and the dashboard to update live via SSE; the `CODER_FAILED`+body-less-probe combination made the headline pipeline unreliable.

---

### 2026-08-29

Changed:
- Implemented Phase 2 (Authentication): DB-backed session auth, register/login/logout/me APIs, protected routes via server-component layout, AuthProvider, wired auth UI/shell.
- Implemented Phase 3 (User Profiles): profile retrieval + update APIs, real profile page with edit modal, settings Profile section backed by real auth state.
- Provisioned PostgreSQL in Docker (`buildhub-pg`); migrated to Prisma 7 `@prisma/adapter-pg` driver-adapter setup (ADR-005).
- Fixed P2002 unique-constraint parsing to read the nested `driverAdapterError.cause.constraint.index` so duplicate email/username return correct field-specific 409s.
- Verified API + browser E2E (14/14) + `lint`/`tsc`/`build` clean. Classified the intentional `/api/auth/me` and `/api/auth/login` 401s as expected in the E2E, keeping all other 4xx/5xx as failures.
- Added ADR-004 (opaque DB-backed session tokens), ADR-005 (Prisma 7 driver adapter), ADR-006 (API response/error envelope).

Reason:
- Move the project from the UI foundation into working authentication and user profiles backed by a real database, with validation evidence (API + E2E + static checks).

---

### 2026-08-29 (2)

Changed:
- Implemented Phase 4 (Posts) and Phase 5 (Projects MVP): `Post` + `Project` Prisma models (migration `20260828192435_add_posts_and_projects`), full CRUD APIs with zod validation, ownership enforcement, project unique-slug generation, and cursor pagination.
- Renumbered phases: Projects is now Phase 5, Social Interactions moves to Phase 6; matched the phase list, section headings, and progress grid.
- Removed mock posts/projects layer and orphaned UI (comments, project tabs, task board); feed, post details, projects, project details, and explore rewired to the real API.
- Deferred likes/comments to Phase 6 (Social Interactions); project members/tasks kept as pending sub-tasks in Phase 5.
- Added committed API verifier `scripts/verify-posts-projects.mjs` (46/46 green) and ran ad-hoc browser E2E (36/36 green) covering full post/project lifecycle, cross-user authorization visibility, project-delete post-unlink semantics, error states, and mobile overflow regression.
- Added ADR-007 (referential actions: `authorId` Cascade, `projectId` SetNull) and ADR-008 (slug suffix strategy from duplicate 2).

Reason:
- Deliver the posts and projects MVP against the real database with ownership + authorization, backed by API and browser validation; set the phase order so the projects feature lands before social interactions.

---

### 2026-08-29 (3)

Changed:
- Implemented Phase 6 — Social Interactions (Likes + Comments): `Like` + `Comment` Prisma models (migration `20260829040353_add_likes_and_comments`), like/unlike API (idempotent `upsert` on `@@unique(userId, postId)`), comment CRUD with server-side ownership (403), comment validation (1–500 chars).
- Extended `lib/server/serializers.ts` with `postInclude(currentUserId?)` so every post query returns `likeCount`, `commentCount`, `likedByMe`; rewired post/project routes to it. Comment serialization includes author + `isMine`.
- Added frontend LikeButton, comment count on cards, and CommentForm/Item/List (inline edit, delete confirm, "edited" badge, skeleton/error/empty states) on the feed and post details.
- Extended `scripts/verify-posts-projects.mjs` to 78/78 green (like/unlike idempotency, per-user liked state, comment CRUD + validation + cross-user 401/403/404, count persistence) and ran ad-hoc browser E2E (28/28 green) incl. cross-user authorization UI and mobile overflow regression.
- Added ADR-009 (like uniqueness via composite constraint + idempotent upsert) and ADR-010 (comment referential actions Cascade).

Reason:
- Complete the social interactions phase (likes + comments) with idempotent, authorization-safe APIs and matching UI, validated by committed API checks and browser E2E before moving to Testing + Observability.

---

### 2026-08-29 (4)

Changed:
- Corrected the roadmap to the agreed 10-phase scope: `Phase 6 → Social Interactions (Likes + Comments)`, followed by Testing + Observability, Security + Attack Detection, AI Self-Healing Engine, Final Integration + Demo.
- Removed Following (10.3), Notifications, and Search phases from the plan; folded Backend Hardening + Testing Infrastructure + Observability under Phase 7, Security Validation under Phase 8, Fault Injection + Failure Scenario Library + Self-Healing Readiness under Phase 9, and Demo Scenarios under Phase 10; renumbered following chapters (progress grid, active/completed tasks, ADRs, change log, etc.).
- Added `PHASE6_TEST_COMMANDS.md` (frontend/) with the exact DB/API/E2E/lint/typecheck/build/migration commands and expected results; committed the full browser E2E as `frontend/scripts/e2e_phase6_full.py`.
- Re-ran the full validation gate: `npm run lint`, `npx tsc --noEmit`, `npm run build` all clean; `node scripts/verify-posts-projects.mjs` 78/78; full browser E2E 32/32 (added §36 console/network monitoring — only `/api/auth/me`→401 allowed — plus explicit like/comment refresh-persistence and direct cross-user API mutation 403 checks); `npx prisma migrate status` up to date (3 migrations).
- Updated the `schema.prisma` header comment to state the social scope is likes + comments only (following/notifications/search out of roadmap).

Reason:
- Reflect the agreed BuildHub roadmap accurately (§43): debugged that the plan listed out-of-scope phases (Following, Notifications, Messaging, Search) and merged future work into the correct phase chapters.

---

### 2026-08-29 (5)

Changed:
- Professional polish + Phase 6 demo-experience pass: added a Three.js floating-blocks landing hero (ADR-011) with a CSS lattice fallback (client-only, gated on WebGL + non-touch + >640px + `prefers-reduced-motion`); subtle pointer-tilt on `ProjectCard`; fixed the dead avatar URL field end-to-end (dead URLs now fall back to initials instead of a broken image); standardized the post-detail skeleton to the shared `PostCardSkeleton`; consolidated the landing footer (removed duplicate `#projects`/`#community` anchors that also collided with the header nav's accessible name).
- Fixed a real settings pre-fill bug: the Profile form initialized `name`/`bio`/`avatar` from `user` while the client `AuthProvider` was still hydrating (user always `null` on first render), so saving without retyping your name failed with "Name is required" (this is exactly the avatar-only use case). Gated the Profile/Account sections on the auth `status` so they mount only after hydration.
- Fixed two latent `e2e_phase6_full.py` defects surfaced by the clean DB reset: (1) the guest block clicked a "Social Milestone" project the test itself had deleted (now uses the stable seed project "RoboNav"); (2) the console monitor flagged Chrome's "Failed to load resource: 401" noise for the already-allowed `/api/auth/me` session probe (real API 4xx/5xx are still caught independently).
- Reset and reseeded the dev demo DB cleanly (all 4 migrations apply, `db:seed` → 6 users / 8 projects / 16 posts / 7 comments).

Reason:
- Fulfill the approved BuildHub professional-polish + Phase 6 demo-experience plan (Polish See #22 and Demo See #61/#62), keeping already-working auth/posts/projects/likes/comments/APIs/DB intact and verified.

Validation:
- `npm run lint` and `npx tsc --noEmit` clean; `npm run build` succeeds (landing fully static/prerendered).
- `node scripts/verify-posts-projects.mjs` → 88 passed, 0 failed.
- Browser E2E `scripts/e2e_phase6_full.py` → 44 passed, 0 failed (incl. console/network monitor + mobile overflow).
- Playwright layout check: desktop/mobile landing, projects, project detail all 0px horizontal overflow; hero `<canvas>` renders on desktop, gates off on mobile/reduced-motion, no Three.js console errors.
- Ann avatar E2E check: avatar saved via settings renders as `<img>` in header + profile; broken/unreachable URL falls back to initials (no broken image).
- Like/unlike verified on seeded data: POST = idempotent like, DELETE = unlike, `likeCount`/`likedByMe` round-trip correctly (0→1→0).

---

### 2026-08-29 (6)

Changed:
- Implemented Phase 7 — Testing + Observability: structured logging (`lib/server/logger.ts`, INFO/WARN/ERROR persisted with request correlation), the observability domain (Prisma `Incident`, `IncidentEvent`, `AgentRun`, `Approval`, `LogEvent`), deterministic scoring + security-finding detection (`lib/server/observability.ts`, ADR-012), authenticated observability APIs (`/api/incidents`, `/api/incidents/[id]`, `/api/incidents/[id]/report`, `/api/logs`, `/api/observability/summary`) plus the public `/api/health`, and pdfkit PDF incident reports (`lib/server/report.ts`).
- Instrumented auth: failed login → `WARN errorCode=AUTH_FAILED`, success/registration → INFO. Extended the idempotent seed with 4 demo incidents (INC-00021/22 active, INC-00014/09 history) + 30 windowed log events so the baseline is deterministic: risk 72 / cyber 94 / health 98 / 2 active.
- Built the AI Command Center (`app/(command)` route group → `/ai`): Overview (auto-refresh, scores/health/findings/live ticker/pipeline snapshot), Incidents list + detail, Live Logs, AI Pipeline (simulated flow preview only), History, Reports; mission-control theme, mobile drawer, server-layout auth gate, Command Center nav link (authed only).
- Added committed tooling: `scripts/verify-observability.mjs` (45/45 baseline assertions), `scripts/reset-observability.mjs` (wipe + reseed determinism), `scripts/e2e_phase7_full.py` (25/25 browser E2E incl. guest redirect, PDF download, console/network + 375px checks), and `PHASE7_COMMAND_CENTER_COMMANDS.md`.
- Added ADR-012 (deterministic observability scoring + detection-only findings + simulated pipeline).

Reason:
- Deliver the observability + testing evidence base that the future AI self-healing engine (Phases 9–10) will consume, keeping every score a pure, verifiable function of state.

Validation:
- `npm run lint` and `npx tsc --noEmit` clean; `npm run build` succeeds and lists all Phase 7 routes.
- `node scripts/verify-observability.mjs` → 45 passed, 0 failed (baseline risk 72 / cyber 94 / health 98 / active 2; window-aware log counts; PDF report bytes).
- Browser E2E `scripts/e2e_phase7_full.py` → 25 passed, 0 failed (guest → login, overview tiles, incidents presets, detail + PDF, logs filter, pipeline stages, reports notice, history, mobile 375px no overflow, no console errors, no unexpected API 4xx/5xx).
- Phase 6 regression `scripts/e2e_phase6_full.py` → 44 passed, 0 failed; `node scripts/verify-posts-projects.mjs` → 88 passed, 0 failed.
- Demo baseline restored to pristine state at the end of validation (reset + reseed), confirmed by 45/45 verify.

---

### 2026-08-29 (7)

Changed:
- Started Phase 8 — Security + Attack Detection with the baseline + schema step (ADR-013): removed the seeded Phase 7 demo observability baseline (no-fake-data rule). `prisma/seed.mjs` now only creates the 4 demo incidents + 30 log events when `SEED_OBSERVABILITY=1`; `scripts/reset-observability.mjs` is wipe-only; `scripts/verify-observability.mjs` rewritten to the clean baseline.
- Migration `20260829104339_phase8_security` added `SecurityFinding` (fingerprint unique, ruleId, severity, signal JSON, status DETECTED/PROCESSED/DISMISSED, hitCount, firstSeen/lastSeen, indexes), `TelegramNotification` (incidentId?, type INCIDENT/ESCALATION/TEST, deliveryStatus QUEUED/SENT/FAILED, telegramMessageId, error), `Incident.detectedBy`, and `AgentRun.model`/`output`/`error` for real (mode="REAL") executions.
- Locked the Phase 8 architecture in the plan: Node `dump-log-events.mjs` → stdlib Python `security_log_analyzer.py` (JSON only) → operator-authenticated `POST /api/security/findings` → Next.js owns incidents/AI (real Groq)/Telegram. Added the 9 detection rules, operator gate (`SECURITY_OPERATOR_USERNAMES`, default `arjun`), AI-honesty contract, and no-client-IP decision.

Reason:
- Phase 8's detection pipeline must analyze real BuildHub logs, so the previous hardcoded demo incidents/scores could not remain the default state; everything downstream is now a pure function of real runtime data.

Validation:
- `npx prisma migrate dev --name phase8_security` applied; `npx prisma generate` clean.
- `node scripts/reset-observability.mjs` wiped to clean state (0 incidents / 0 log events / 0 findings / 0 telegram).
- Re-ran `npx prisma db seed` — demo incidents NOT recreated (gate works).
- `node scripts/verify-observability.mjs` → 28 passed, 0 failed against a running server (risk 0 / cyber 100 / health 100 / active 0 / all components healthy / zero findings / empty logs).

---

### 2026-08-30

Changed:
- Completed Phase 9 — AI Self-Healing Engine: controlled fault injection with 9 faults (LOW-01..03, MEDIUM-01..03, HIGH-01..03) wired into the posts/projects/auth/validation code paths, gated behind `FAULT_INJECTION_ENABLED=true` and managed via the `/api/faults` API (activate/deactivate/deactivate-all).
- Added fault-injection core (`lib/server/fault-injection.ts`) + handlers (`fault-injection-handlers.ts`), dynamic LOW-03 server-side validation (`.superRefine`), and HIGH-03 simulated DB outage (503).
- Added an Approval state machine (PENDING/APPROVED/REJECTED/EXPIRED/CONSUMED), the singular `ApprovalStatus` enum, Telegram dedupe (unique `(incidentId, type)` + cooldown), `POST /api/approvals/create`, `POST /api/approvals/proceed`, and `POST /api/incidents/[id]/apply-patch`.
- Fixed DB issue where `approvals.status` was TEXT instead of the enum → Prisma `42883` (P2039) on `findFirst`; migration `20260830000000_fix_approval_status_enum` cast it to `ApprovalStatus`. `handleApiError` now maps FK violation (P2003) to 400.
- Wired the real Fixer/Critic/Judge pipeline surface + AI chat (`/api/ai/chat`) + repair memory (`/api/ai/memory`) + 3D endpoint (`/api/ai/visualization`). Added `PHASE9_FAULT_TEST_PLAN.md` + `AI_CODEBASE_MAP.md`.
- Marked Phase 8 Steps 7–8 and scenario status checkboxes (E001..E003, M001..M003, D001..D003) as complete; D004 noted as deferred to demo-pipeline work.

Reason:
- The next project milestone is the self-healing demo scenarios (Detect → Fix/Candidate → Approval → Rollback), which require injectable, reversible, documented faults plus an approval/rollback path.

Validation:
- Phase 8 prerequisite: `verify-security.mjs` 32/32; `verify-posts-projects.mjs` 88/88; Phase 6 E2E 44/44; Phase 7 E2E 25/25.
- Phase 9: `verify-self-healing.mjs` 67/67 (all 9 faults activate/trigger/deactivate; LOW-02 typo, MEDIUM-03 authz, HIGH-01/02/03, approvals, apply-patch all pass); `e2e_phase9_full.py` 64/64.
- Clean-state final observability baseline re-verified (`verify-observability.mjs` 28/28) after `reset-observability.mjs` wipe; all 9 faults deactivated.
- `npm run lint` 0 errors (10 pre-existing unused-import warnings), `npx tsc --noEmit` exit 0, `npm run build` green.

---
  
### 2026-08-30 (2)

Changed:
- Completed the iterative self-healing engine (Phase 9) + learning loop (Phase 10): fault incidents now flow through `runSelfHealingRepair` (evidence → up to 3 Coder/Critic/Judge rounds → deterministic risk → verified candidate → real HTTP validation probe → RESOLVED/ROLLED_BACK; HIGH risk human-gated via `repairAttemptId`-bound approvals). Legacy security incidents keep the Phase 8 analysis pipeline.
- Added the hermetic TEST-provider `scenario` contracts (`accept-round-1|2|3`, `reject-all`, `judge-reject`) forwarded only to the TEST provider; added `RepairAttempt`/`PatchRecord`/`RepairMemory`/`RepairExperience` tables + `Incident.metadata` (migrations `20260830090000_*`, `20260830091000_*`).
- Added Phase 10 learning: reward policy, repair memory, normalized RL experiences + dataset + visualization exports, evaluation harness, `/api/ai/{chat,memory,learning,rl-dataset,evaluate,experiences,visualization}`, Learning dashboard (`/ai/learning`), Security Self-Healing Console chat, live incident-detail transcript + polling.
- Fixed: engine reported pre-repair `stage` on no-candidate/unsafe-candidate failures (now honest `AI_REPAIR_FAILED`); `createApproval` swallowed FK errors as collision retries (now propagate + route 404s for unknown incidents); client/server ApprovalDTO mismatch resolved (friendly decision/reviewer/outcome, pending state).
- Added ADR-014 (iterative engine + provider separation), ADR-015 (fault patch-on-activate + disarm/rearm + incident ingestion). Added `PHASE10_LEARNING_COMMANDS.md`; upgraded `verify-self-healing.mjs` + new `e2e_phase10_learning.py`; updated `AI_CODEBASE_MAP.md`/`PHASE9_FAULT_TEST_PLAN.md`.

Reason:
- Deliver the three demo scenarios (fix, bad-candidate drawn from honest round iteration, failed-deployment rollback) with a real, deterministic, approval-gated repair loop and a truthful learning dataset for the future platform.

Validation:
- `npm run lint` 0 errors (11 pre-existing unused-import warnings), `npx tsc --noEmit` exit 0, `npm run build` green.
- `node scripts/verify-self-healing.mjs` → 80 passed, 0 failed (fault → incident → engine → random-fault, approvals, telegram, chat, memory, viz).
- `python3 scripts/e2e_phase10_learning.py` → 50 passed, 0 failed (real LOW-01 repair ROLLED_BACK + real HIGH-01 approval → continue → terminal stage, learning APIs/data, Learning dashboard, console chat, incident transcript, mobile, no console/4xx).
- `python3 scripts/e2e_phase9_full.py` → 64 passed, 0 failed (regression).
- Clean-state regressions after `reset-observability.mjs`: `verify-observability.mjs` 28/28, `verify-security.mjs` 32/32, `verify-posts-projects.mjs` 88/88.
- Final demo state seeded with a real LOW-01 repair (1 RL row + 1 experience, all faults deactivated, sources healthy).

---

### 2026-08-30 (3)

Changed:
- Created a separate, isolated **BuildHub — No-AI demo** at `buildhub-no-ai/` (a full copy of `frontend` with all AI/self-healing code, AI scripts, AI docs, and PDF/command-center bits removed). Deliberately IDENTICAL normal app behavior — same schema (10 migrations), same seeded data, same every-day login/posts/projects/UI — and the SAME controlled LOW-01 fault, so the comparison is honest: without AI the fault stays UNRESOLVED.
- No-AI specifics: port 3001, isolated DB `buildhub_no_ai` (same `buildhub-pg` container), own `.env`/`.env.local` (no GROQ/TELEGRAM keys), `lib/server/fault-injection.ts` reduced to a single LOW-01 registry, demo-only `/api/demo/fault` (activate/deactivate/reset), `/api/demo/logs`, and `/demo` page showing `AI SELF-HEALING: OFF` + real 500 + real persisted `log_events` rows. `npm run demo:reset` restores the clean start without touching source.
- Copy-only fix: `20260830000000_fix_approval_status_enum` had the original history's latent bug (referenced `ApprovalStatus` enum that no migration created); added the `CREATE TYPE` to the copy so a fresh demo DB deploys.
- Added `buildhub-no-ai/README.md`, `BUILDHUB_AI_VS_NO_AI.md`, `demo-reset.mjs`, and `e2e_no_ai_demo.py` (Playwright: login, /demo, trigger LOW-01 → real 500 `Cannot read property 'id' of undefined`, durable DB log, zero incidents/agent_runs/repair_attempts, zero AI-provider requests, byte-identical sources, fault stays active).

Reason:
- Provide the deterministic counter-example for the demo: the SAME fault and SAME trigger must fail without AI and resolve with AI. Prove it honestly (no fake errors, no artificial "fail").

Validation:
- `npm run lint` 0 errors, `npx tsc --noEmit` exit 0, `npm run build` green (routes include `/demo`, `/api/demo/fault`, `/api/demo/logs`).
- `prisma migrate deploy` (10/10) + `db:seed` on `buildhub_no_ai`.
- `python3 scripts/e2e_no_ai_demo.py` → 28 passed, 0 failed.
- `npm run demo:reset` verified (deactivates LOW-01, clears demo log trail; leftover rows are genuine auth/health ops logs).
- Original `frontend/` project untouched; No-AI dev server stopped after validation (port 3001 free).

---

### 2026-08-30 (4)

Changed:
- Completed the **"same attack" comparison demo** (final demo scenario): an IDENTICAL forged sign-in burst (`burst{nnn}@local.invalid`, pass `7aX-contr0l-local`, `X-Request-Id` stamped) fired at both builds on loopback via stdlib-only `scripts/attack_common.py` (`run-port3000.py` → WITH-AI `:3000`, `run-port3001.py` → WITHOUT-AI `:3001`; `--confirm-local`, target whitelist, max 500 req/60s/concurrency 4, health poll 0.5s, terminal stop on evidence: No-AI 3× consecutive `/health unavailable`, AI 20× consecutive 429).
- WITHOUT-AI behavior (honest failure, no supervisor): login route latches on a global phase derived from real persisted `log_events` (`AUTH_FAILED`/`ATTACK_DEGRADED`/`ATTACK_UNAVAILABLE`; degrade @40, unavailable @60 within 60s) → `/api/auth/login` and `/api/health` return 503; recovery requires an operator restart or signed-in `POST /api/demo/attack {action:'reset'}` (fresh process start = clean boot). Rewrote `lib/server/demo-availability.ts` to be **DB-derived** because Next.js 16.3.3 runs each route handler isolate with its own `globalThis` — module/global in-memory maps are NOT shared across routes (verified empirically, incl. worker threads); persisted rows give every route the same truth.
- WITH-AI behavior (real mitigation): `lib/server/auth-guard.ts` source-IP guard (10 failures/60s window → `AUTH_BURST` detection log → detached escalation runs the real security.py ingestion/promote/agent pipeline → temporary 120s source block on `/api/auth/login` returning 429 + `IP_BLOCKED` rows). New DB-derived `attackOverview()` feeds `/api/demo/attack` telemetry across isolates (phase normal→attack→detected→mitigating→recovered); observability auth-health now uses a 60s live window so overall health returns `ok` while the block is still active (service stays available — `0` 5xx during the run).
- Demo surfaces: public `/api/demo/attack` telemetry (both builds; AI build POST `reset` is operator-gated via `requireSecurityOperator` and also clears the previous run's AUTH_BURST incident/finding/log artifacts), No-AI `/api/demo/attack/ai` bridge (`AI_DEMO_BASE_URL`), `/demo/attack` live side-by-side comparison page (polls every 2.5s, per-build timeline/metrics/incident/agent-run panels), link from `/demo`. `AUTH_GUARD_*`/`DEMO_AUTH_*`/`AI_DEMO_BASE_URL` documented in `.env.example`.

Reason:
- Deliver final demo scenario 1 (No-AI failure → AI detection → mitigation → healthy) deterministically and honestly; no replayed/faked data — health, incidents (real INC-00002 SEC_100_auth_burst HIGH risk 24), and agent runs (FIXER/CRITIC/JUDGE real Groq pipeline) are real outcomes of the same attack.

Validation:
- `npm run lint` 0 errors (ungrepped 11 pre-existing warnings in AI, 1 in No-AI), `npx tsc --noEmit` exit 0, `npm run build` green on BOTH builds.
- TEST 1 (No-AI, `run-port3001.py --confirm-local`): 61×401 → 323×503, `/health` latched `unavailable` (503), telemetry `phase=unavailable` (degraded 04:28:20.755, unavailable 04:28:20.892), script exited 0 (designed outcome observed); restart recovered `/health ok`.
- TEST 2 (AI, `run-port3000.py --confirm-local`): 12×401 → guard triggered → 148×429, **0 5xx/conn errors**, peak latency 98ms, recovery to `/health ok` in ~61s, script exited 0; incident `INC-00002` HIGH `AWAITING_REVIEW` risk 24 + 3 agent runs (FIXER/CRITIC/JUDGE COMPLETE) + `blocked` until mitigation window elapse.
- Cross-route consistency probe on :3001: at failure #40 telemetry showed `phase=degraded fail=40`, at #60 `unavailable fail=60` while login returned 503 — login/health/telemetry agree from the same persisted rows.
- Playwright smoke: login as arjun on :3001, `/demo/attack` renders WITHOUT-AI + WITH-AI panels with live data (INC-00002 shown, HEALTHY, auto-refresh timer), zero console errors; AI build normal arjun login still 200.
- Regressions: `verify-posts-projects.mjs` 88/88; the AI-side AUTH_BURST demo artifact (INC-00002) intentionally left in place as a live evidence row.
- `e2e_phase7_full.py` still not re-run (requires destructive `reset-observability.mjs` wipe of the dev DB — deferred).

---

### 2026-08-30 (7)

Changed:
- Added `attack-demo/run-overload.py` — the hard-overload comparison client (repo root, stdlib-only, imports nothing from `frontend/`/`buildhub-no-ai/`). SAME multi-endpoint workload on both ports: forged `POST /api/auth/login` (`burst<nnn>@local.invalid`), rate-bounded to 12/s via a thread-safe `LoginScheduler`, plus sustained `GET /api/posts` / `/api/projects` / `/api/health`. Hard caps `MAX_DURATION=20s`, `MAX_REQUESTS=3000` (ceiling 4000), `MAX_CONCURRENCY=16` (default 9); hosts `127.0.0.1|localhost|::1`, ports `3000|3001` only; `--confirm-local` mandatory fail-closed; stops immediately on health UNAVAILABLE / 429 (AI mitigation) / caps / Ctrl+C; never kills/restarts/manipulates processes, OS, network, files or DBs. Prints a REAL observed timeline (start, traffic-100, health DEGRADED/UNAVAILABLE, first 503/429, incident, pipeline agent events), live counters (sent / rps / avg / p95 / 2xx / 4xx / 5xx / err), and `ATTACK RESULT` + `VERDICT`. GET endpoint picker uses Knuth multiplicative hashing so posts/projects/health all get traffic; login stream decoupled from GET mix so the no-AI thresholds unfold over visible seconds. Fixed a non-reentrant `threading.Lock` deadlock in the health watcher (emit moved outside the lock).
- Extended `attack-demo/test_attack_safety.py` to validate both clients (per-script limit specs incl. login-rate caps; CLI fail-closed for `--confirm-local`, host, port, `--login-rate`, weights). 83 checks passed, 0 failed, no network.
- buildhub-no-ai (additive, demo-only presentation — normal app behavior unchanged):
  - `components/demo/service-unavailable-gate.tsx` — DEMO-ONLY client gate wired into `app/layout.tsx` (server-side `process.env.DEMO_UNAVAILABLE_GATE`, default true, added to `.env.example`). Driven ONLY by the real `/api/health`: full-screen "SERVICE UNAVAILABLE / BuildHub is temporarily unavailable. / Cause: Excessive authentication/API traffic detected. / System status: OFFLINE / Recovery: Operator restart/reset required." when health reports `unavailable`, slim DEGRADED banner when `degraded`, nothing otherwise; never fakes or hides outages; `/demo/*` stays reachable so the comparison + reset flow keep working.
  - `app/(app)/demo/attack/page.tsx` upgrade — new step trails WITHOUT AI (NORMAL→ATTACK→TRAFFIC SPIKE→RESOURCE PRESSURE→SERVICE UNAVAILABLE→503 ERROR PAGE) and WITH AI (NORMAL→ATTACK→DETECTION→CODER→CRITIC→JUDGE→RISK→MITIGATION→429 BLOCK→SERVICE HEALTHY) derived from REAL telemetry (failCount vs thresholds, health state, `timestamps.detectedAt/mitigatedAt`, incident riskScore, `agentRuns` FIXER/CRITIC/JUDGE, `IP_BLOCKED` events, blockedCount). Real metric additions: Health HTTP (200 / 503), Availability, 429 blocked events, real pipeline status line (FIXER ✓ · CRITIC ✓ · JUDGE ✓). Live request/rps/latency/2xx/4xx/5xx counters are honestly attributed to the `run-overload.py` console (no server-side request logger exists — verified: no `RequestLog` model, proxy.ts is correlation-only). Footer now links to `http://127.0.0.1:3001/` to open the real 503 / SERVICE UNAVAILABLE page.
  - `next.config.ts` — `allowedDevOrigins: ["127.0.0.1", "localhost"]` (Next dev blocks dev resources from non-localhost origins; the demo is accessed over both).
- Docs: `attack-demo/HARD_OVERLOAD_DEMO.md` (full runbook with the measured numbers below) and `attack-demo/README.md` overload section.

Reason:
- User requested the Phase 10 demo upgrade: an independent, hard-capped, `--confirm-local` loopback overload client (multi-endpoint, 20s cap) driving the no-AI build to its real 503/unavailable state and the WITH-AI build through its real detection→pipeline→risk→mitigation→429→recovery, a demo-only real-health-driven SERVICE UNAVAILABLE frontend state on the no-AI app, a professional side-by-side :3001 comparison page with real metrics only, a printed real-observed demo timeline, and a before/after HARD_OVERLOAD_DEMO.md. Existing attack scripts (`run_attack.py`, etc.) kept working. Nothing in the apps was modified except additive demo presentation UI + dev config + `next.config.ts`; no secrets, no source-code fault changes.

Validation:
- `cd buildhub-no-ai && npm run lint` (0 errors; 1 pre-existing warning in `scripts/demo-reset.mjs`), `npx tsc --noEmit` clean, `npm run build` clean; `python3 attack-demo/test_attack_safety.py` → 83 checks passed, 0 failed.
- Recorded live comparison executed and verified in a real browser (session-authenticated pages, Playwright):
  - WITHOUT-AI :3001 → degraded at 3.7s, UNAVAILABLE at 5.0s; 330 requests/5.1s, 2xx 265 · 4xx 60 · 5xx 5 (503); posts 120 · projects 95 · health 55 · login 60; final `/api/health` 503. Root page showed the SERVICE UNAVAILABLE gate; `/demo/attack` showed RESOURCE PRESSURE → SERVICE UNAVAILABLE → 503 ERROR PAGE. Operator reset → health 200, gate gone.
  - WITH-AI :3000 → contained at 1.3s: 46 requests, 2xx 25 · 4xx 21 (401×12, 429×9) · 5xx 0; incident INC-00002 HIGH risk 24; FIXER/CRITIC/JUDGE all COMPLETE round 1; firstFailure 10:30:08.266 → detected 10:30:08.469 (~0.2s) → mitigated 10:30:09.092 (~0.8s); 9× IP_BLOCKED 429; health never below degraded; block (120s) expired → phase `recovered`, health `ok`, stayed stable 10+ min. `/demo/attack` on :3001 showed the full WITH-AI chain then SERVICE HEALTHY.
  - Both demo states reset to NORMAL afterwards; both `/api/health` 200. Screenshots in `/tmp/ui/`; run records `/tmp/record-noai.out`, `/tmp/record-ai.out`.

---

### 2026-08-30 (8)

Changed:
- Completed the Telegram alert-delivery overhaul (ADR-016). Root cause: `api.telegram.org` IPv6 AAAA records intermittently hung the default Node socket path (`ETIMEDOUT`) while `curl -4` worked — the transport now forces IPv4 (`family: 4` + `autoSelectFamily: false`) with `rejectUnauthorized: true`, 12s timeout, and retry up to 3 only on network/429/5xx (400/401/403 never retried).
- Delivery is now an append-only audit log: write-once rows, `SENT` only on real `ok:true` response, permanent per-`(incidentId, type)` dedupe at send time recording `SKIPPED_DUPLICATE` (no `@@unique`, so no silent P2002 drops and no fabricated rows when Telegram is unconfigured). Migration `20260830120000_add_telegram_summary_types` extends `NotificationType`/`DeliveryStatus` enums.
- Canonical message builders in `lib/server/notifications/summary.ts`; initial `INCIDENT` alert now fires at incident creation (`promoteFindingsToIncidents` in `security.ts` + `createFaultIncident` in `repair/ingest.ts` via `sendIncidentAlert`), `ESCALATION` after AI analysis, HIGH-approval and `FINAL_SUMMARY` terminal messages from persisted facts; `telegramAlreadySent` dedupe cooldown removed.
- Delivery state surfaced everywhere from the same persisted rows: `GET /api/security/status` telegram block (connectivity `getMe` + lastDelivery + lastIncident), new authenticated SSE feed `/api/security/events` (snapshot + delivery + keepalive) consumed by Overview "Telegram Delivery" card + Security view, incident-detail "Alert Delivery" card + terminal summary, PDF sections 6.5/6.6, and AI chat system prompt (real 24h delivery facts). `app/api/ai/chat` unchanged surface.
- New verification: `scripts/test-telegram-integration.mjs` (HTTP surface + DB enum/schema contract) and `scripts/e2e_telegram_notifications.py` (browser, MEDIUM-01 → incident → INCIDENT alert → SENT delivery → PDF → /ai feed). Doc `frontend/TELEGRAM_ALERTING.md`.

Validation:
- `npx tsc --noEmit` clean; `npx eslint` clean on all touched files (fixed `loadFinalCandidate` unused-param warning, engine ROLLED_BACK brace, Approval decision derivation, `.leading` PDF removal, telegram type cast).
- `npm run build` green (`/api/security/events` listed as dynamic route).
- Live validation against the running dev server (final bug-fix loop): `node scripts/test-telegram-integration.mjs` → **32 passed, 0 failed** (real IPv4-forced send, `getMe` reachable + bot username, TEST persisted SENT with message id, recent feed reflects it, detail `telegram.deliveries` contract, DB enums + no-unique-key); `python3 scripts/e2e_telegram_notifications.py` → **21 passed, 0 failed** (MEDIUM-01 → incident → real INCIDENT SENT alert with message id → status lastDelivery SENT → PDF → incident-detail Alert Delivery card → /ai Telegram Delivery live feed/badge → deactivate). `node scripts/verify-posts-projects.mjs` → 88/88 regression green.
- Live validation surfaced (and this session fixed) two latent defects that static checks could not catch: (1) `sendTelegram` built the request path without the `/bot<token>` prefix (token param was unused) — every send would have 404'd; (2) incident-less `TEST` deliveries were never persisted, so the audit log + `recent` feed could not show a successful conduit test — `recordDelivery` now accepts `incidentId: null` and always records.
- `verify-security.mjs` → 28 passed, 4 failed: the 4 failures are its clean-baseline assertions (`riskScore = 0`, `tier = dashboard`, `zero incidents`, `zero telegram history`) and fail because the dev DB holds real incidents (incl. the intentionally kept INC-00002 demo evidence + the fresh MEDIUM-01 test incident). Full 32/32 requires a destructive `reset-observability.mjs` wipe that would remove that demo evidence, so it is deferred rather than run unrequested. `verify-observability.mjs`, `verify-self-healing.mjs`, `e2e_phase9_full.py`, `e2e_phase10_learning.py` likewise deferred (they are designed to run against a clean reset baseline / consume destructive wipes).

---

### 2026-08-30 (9)

Changed:
- Completed the canonical incident briefing + risk-based approval redesign (ADR-017). New `lib/server/notifications/brief.ts` exposes `buildIncidentBrief(incidentId)` — one persisted source of truth (Incident/RepairAttempt/AgentRun/PatchRecord/Approval/TelegramNotification) powering Telegram, the incident-detail terminal card, PDF §6.6, and AI chat; missing steps render `n/a`/`Pending AI analysis…`, never invented facts. Helpers `isAttackIncident`, `parseProbeResult`, `approvalDecision`, `finalStateOf` (REJECTED/EXPIRED precedence).
- `lib/server/notifications/summary.ts` rebuilt on the brief: attack-aware `INCIDENT` (ten sections + `🛡️ BUILDHUB ATTACK` telemetry), LOW/MEDIUM `ESCALATION` AUTO-APPLY plans (`sendRepairPlanMessage` before `applyCandidate` in the repair engine), `HIGH_RISK_APPROVAL_REQUIRED` (`PROCEED <id>` / `REJECT <id>` + 5-min expiry), terminal `FINAL_SUMMARY` per final state (RESOLVED / ROLLED_BACK / REJECTED / EXPIRED / AI_REPAIR_FAILED) with System Health / Cyber Score / Site Risk lines via a dependency-free local `systemSnapshot()`. Progression budget fixed at INCIDENT (1) → ESCALATION or HIGH_RISK_APPROVAL_REQUIRED (1) → FINAL_SUMMARY (1), all deduped to one SENT per `(incidentId, type)`.
- REJECT/EXPIRY now finalize honestly: `POST /api/approvals/proceed` REJECT writes an `IncidentEvent`, marks the attempt REJECTED (status `AI_REPAIR_FAILED`), and sends the rejected/expired terminal summary; incidents can finish with `terminalSummary.finalState` `REJECTED`/`EXPIRED`; `continueApprovedRepair` consumes the approval in both RESOLVED and ROLLED_BACK branches. Client unions widened (`IncidentStatus` 8 values, `finalState` 5 values); incident-detail terminal card renders friendly REJECTED/EXPIRED labels ("approval rejected by operator" / "approval expired — no human decision").
- SSE `/api/security/events` now also streams a `lifecycle` event (initial snapshot + per-poll diffs of incidents/events/agentRuns/approvals/repairs, capacity 24) consumed by `subscribeSecurityEvents({ onLifecycle })` → Overview "Incident Lifecycle" card; fixed an SSE slice edge (`seenIdx === -1 ? rows : rows.slice(0, seenIdx)`).
- AI chat context rebuilt from the canonical brief of the latest incident; when the latest delivery FAILED the context asserts "Telegram delivery failed."; `lib/api/security.ts` closure-narrowing TS error fixed.
- New `scripts/test-incident-briefing.mjs` (17 numbered checks: source-of-truth oracle = real persisted SENT `TelegramNotification` messages; canonical INCIDENT/ESCALATION/FINAL_SUMMARY + approval + terminal + chat + PDF string + no-secrets, pre-revision legacy alerts excluded by `TRIGGER` content signature). `scripts/e2e_telegram_notifications.py` extended with `deliveries_of`/`delivery_of`/`terminal_body` helpers and a repair-progression block that triggers `POST /api/security/run` and asserts SENT `ESCALATION` + `FINAL_SUMMARY`, exactly-one dedupe, terminal summary + System Health/Cyber Score + outcome, detail terminal card, Overview "Incident Lifecycle" card, and chat 200.

Validation:
- `npx tsc --noEmit` clean and `npx eslint` clean on all touched files (final fix loop: widened `IncidentStatus`/`finalState` unions, `const onLifecycle = handlers.onLifecycle` closure narrowing, REJECTED/EXPIRED terminal card, SSE slice guard).
- Serial left-to-right (queued e2e runs) against an operator-authenticated TEST-mode dev server (`SELF_HEALING_TEST_MODE=true AI_PROVIDER=test`, real Telegram creds resolution): `node scripts/test-incident-briefing.mjs` → **17 passed, 0 failed** on the currently populated DB (scenarios A + E live: MEDIUM-01 auto-apply ROLLED_BACK run + attack incident CHECKS; scenario coverage B HIGH PROCEED / C REJECT / D EXPIRY pending the demo runs); `python3 scripts/e2e_telegram_notifications.py` → **36 passed, 0 failed** (first run 24/8 failed without the run-repair trigger — repaired pattern is `POST /api/security/run` only, not automatic on fault activation); second run produced a real ROLLED_BACK terminal exercising scenario E end-to-end. DB now holds 6 incidents / 8 canonical SENT deliveries (2 pre-brief legacy INCIDENT alerts excluded by TRIGGER signature); leftover INC-00005 stuck DETECTED from the first failed run kept as honest evidence (repair was never triggered; fault since deactivated).
- Full validation matrix (lint/tsc/build, `test-telegram-integration.mjs`, Phase 6–10 regressions), the remaining demo scenarios (B/C/D), groq-mode restoration, fault deactivation, and the section-27 PASS/FAIL report remain open — running after this docs pass.

---

### 2026-08-30 (6)

Changed:
- Added `attack-demo/` — an independent localhost attack demonstration for the final BEFORE/AFTER demo, at repo root, NOT integrated into either app (imports nothing from `frontend/` or `buildhub-no-ai/`; stdlib-only Python 3):
  - `run_attack.py`: one attack client, `python3 attack-demo/run_attack.py --port 3001|3000 --confirm-local`. Hard caps `MAX_REQUESTS=300`, `MAX_DURATION=60s`, `MAX_CONCURRENCY=5`, hosts hard-wired to `127.0.0.1`, ports whitelisted to 3000/3001, `--confirm-local` mandatory, fail-closed. Uses the exact real login endpoint `POST /api/auth/login` with forged `burst<nnn>@local.invalid` credentials — identical vector/pattern on both ports (only the port differs). Stops immediately on health unavailable / HTTP 429 (AI containment) / request limit / timeout / Ctrl+C. NEVER kills/restarts/manipulates any server process. Prints a real per-request observation log (timestamp · number · status · latency · health) plus an honest `ATTACK RESULT` (Target / Requests / 401 / 403 / 429 / 5xx / Peak latency / Final health / Stop reason). Fixed a non-reentrant `threading.Lock` deadlock (health snapshot taken inside the locked section).
  - `test_attack_safety.py`: 35 checks (source integrity, stdlib-only imports, banned process/OS/network primitives, hard limits, loopback-only policy, fail-closed CLI). No network.
  - `README.md` (quick runbook) and `ATTACK_DEMO.md` (12-point technical doc, all values from verified source).
- No-AI demo story verified live on :3001: pre-flight `ok` → 60×401 → degraded from request #41 → latch at #60 → 10×503 → stopped at 70 requests/1.0s, final `/api/health` `unavailable` (HTTP 503), exit 0. Recovery proven WITHOUT process restart via signed-in `POST /api/demo/attack {action:"reset"}` → health 200, phase `normal`, failCount 0.
- WITH-AI demo story verified live on :3000: 10×401 crossed AUTH_GUARD threshold (10/60s) → real AUTH_BURST detection → block armed → 10×429 → `ATTACK CONTAINED`, 0×5xx, 20 requests/0.1s, exit 0. Real incident `INC-00002` (HIGH, riskScore 24, `AWAITING_REVIEW`), FIXER/CRITIC/JUDGE agent runs all COMPLETE. Health `degraded`(200) at stop then `ok` (200) ~35s later with `systemHealth:100`, all 5 components healthy; telemetry `mitigating` → `recovered` (block expires 120s).
- Demo surfaces verified after runs: `GET /api/health` :3000 200, `/ai` Command Center 200 (real page), `/demo/attack` comparison UI on :3001 200.

Reason:
- User requested an independent attack client for the final demo that shows the WITHOUT-AI build failing under the same bounded attack and the WITH-AI build detecting + mitigating it. Attacker must not manipulate the server; all limits hard-capped; real observations only. Existing No-AI fault (`demo-availability.ts` "LOCAL DEMO LIMITATION", thresholds 40/60/60s) and existing AI guard (`auth-guard.ts` 10/60s → 120s block → 429) were reused unchanged — nothing added to either app.

Validation:
- `python3 attack-demo/test_attack_safety.py` → 35 checks passed, 0 failed (both before and after the deadlock fix).
- Live runs recorded in `/tmp/attack3001.out` (70 req, 60×401, 10×503, peak 140ms, final unavailable) and `/tmp/attack3000.out` (20 req, 10×401, 10×429, 0×5xx, peak 56ms, contained).
- No-AI recovery via operator reset (no restart); AI auto-recovery observed; all three demo surfaces return HTTP 200.
- `ATTACK_DEMO.md` documents all 12 required topics with values cross-checked against source (auth routes, auth-guard, demo-availability, health routes, demo/attack routes, UI page step trails).

---

### 2026-08-30 (5)

Changed:
- Added `BUILDHUB_DEMO_AND_TEST_COMMANDS.md` — the single operator/demo/test command reference covering all 24 requested sections: startup (no docker-compose; `docker start buildhub-pg`), login/seed (password `buildhub-demo1`, emails `<username>@buildhub.dev`, operator `arjun`), /ai Command Center pages, the same-attack demo (bridged comparison page lives on :3001 `/demo/attack`; :3000 has only `/api/demo/attack`), all 9 faults (file/line/original→fault/trigger/error/fix/probe), exact fault API + random selector + multi-agent rounds + rollback + chat + Telegram (outbound-only, PROCEED format, 5-min dedupe) + learning/RL (APIs, no CLI exporter), full test matrix, clean baseline (with DESTRUCTIVE warning for `reset-observability.mjs`), safe stop (port-targeted kill, never `pkill node`), 5-minute demo, file/line table, source-of-truth discrepancy list (§22), and capability classification.

Reason:
- Docs-only deliverable requested by the user. Written from verified source (registry/probes/routes/scripts read, thresholds + response shapes cross-checked; `faults` POST returns `{success, faultId, action, incident}`; approval PROCEED accepts JSON or raw `PROCEED APR-…`; random selector 409 when all active; AUTH_GUARD 10/60s/120s, DEMO_AUTH 40/60/60s, cookie `buildhub_session`).

Validation:
- No code, DB, migration, or `.env` files changed; no servers started/modified. All commands/sections cross-checked against `frontend/lib/server/fault-injection.ts`, `repair/validation.ts`, `app/api/faults/*`, `app/api/approvals/proceed`, `auth-guard.ts`, `demo-availability.ts`, `PHASE9_FAULT_TEST_PLAN.md`, `AI_CODEBASE_MAP.md`, and prior `PLAN.md` entries.

---

### 2026-08-28

Changed:
- Completed Phase 1 UI Foundation implementation (design system, mock data layer, app shell, all core pages).
- Made `npm run lint`, `npx tsc --noEmit`, and `next build` pass cleanly.
- Refactored `useAsync` to comply with React 19 lint rules (fetch-on-mount + `refetch`; client-side filtering; keyed-child pattern for dynamic routes).
- Added `frontend/.env.example`, `frontend/README.md`, `app/(app)/loading.tsx`.
- Added ADR-001 (Next.js 16 + TS + Tailwind v4) and ADR-002 (defer test runner).
- Fixed route conflict: feed moved to `/feed` (was unreachable at `/`), nav + logo updated (ADR-003).

Reason:
- Move project forward to a shippable UI foundation before backend/auth phases; keep validation honest (build/type/lint clean).

# 27. Final Project Objective

The finished system should provide a realistic BuildHub application that can demonstrate the complete future lifecycle:

```

BuildHub should therefore be developed as a **real application first** and a **self-healing test environment second**.

The application must remain useful and functional independently of the future AI system.

Canonical briefing scenarios now covered by real persisted SENT deliveries
(`test-incident-briefing.mjs` DB coverage key): **A, B, E, C, D, ATTACK** —
LOW/MEDIUM auto-apply ESCALATION (A), the ROLLED_BACK validation-failure (E),
HIGH PROCEED→RESOLVED (B), HIGH REJECT→REJECTED (C), HIGH EXPIRY→EXPIRED (D),
and the attack/correlated incident (ATTACK). Coverage note: LOW/MEDIUM `FINAL_SUMMARY` RESOLVED terminals and an approved-then-resolved HIGH incident were validated live during the earlier Phase 10 `e2e_phase10_learning.py` run (50/50); the remaining demo-specific flows are listed above.

Demo scenario evidence (all on real Telegram via the canonical brief):

```text
A   LOW/MEDIUM auto-apply  → terminal RESOLVED/ROLLED_BACK  (e2e_telegram 36/36 + briefing A/E)
B   HIGH PROCEED           → terminal RESOLVED              (demo_approval_scenarios 40/40)
C   HIGH REJECT            → terminal REJECTED              (demo_approval_scenarios 40/40)
D   HIGH EXPIRY (backdated)→ terminal EXPIRED               (demo_approval_scenarios 40/40)
```

Deferred (documented, not silently skipped): `verify-observability.mjs`,
`verify-security.mjs`, `e2e_phase7/8/9/10` clean-state scripts assert a wiped
baseline (`riskScore=0`, zero incidents) and so require the DESTRUCTIVE
`reset-observability.mjs` wipe, which would delete real demo evidence
(6 pre-demo + 21 demo incidents); they were validated clean in earlier phases
(28/28, 32/32, 25/25, 26/26, 64/64, 50/50) and are re-runnable only after a
user-approved wipe. `incidents=27 · deliveries=50 · SENT=50 · canonical=50`.

Incident found and fixed during demo validation: `HIGH-01` Authentication
Bypass fault never actually fired at the login boundary — the route imported
`applyHigh01AuthBypass` but computed the password check directly. Wired the
guard in `app/api/auth/login/route.ts:66` so wrong-password logins return 200
only while the fault is guarded; scenario B's defect-fire assertion now passes.
